The thought crossed my mind today that two of my favorite ideas are expressing the same sentiment pointed in different directions. Gandhi's famous "Be the change you want to see in the world" and Timothy Wilson's slightly lesser-known "to become the person you want to be, start acting like that person would act" I believe are expressing the truism.

There is no magic or tricks or shortcuts. Only humans and choices that lead to outcomes. It is one of those things that silly and obvious, but also deep and profound. Gandhi applied it externally to the world. Wilson applied it internally.
