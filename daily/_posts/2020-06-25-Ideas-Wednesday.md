Ideas for Leaderboard Wednesdays:
- Work more hours than ever
- Run a faster mile
- Run a longer distance
- Take a cold shower for longer
- Do more pull-ups
- Set a larger programming goal don't stop until done
- Do more "bitch work" items on my todo list
- The idea is to push through a little resistance and push back old age and complacency :)

Yesterday's inaugural Leaderboard Wednesday was good. I attempted to win a poker hand/endurance /rake challenge by playing 16-18 hours. While I did not win I did push myself mentally which was the goal/system. I learned a hell of a lot, made a little bonus cash, and am thoroughly enjoying my day off today.
