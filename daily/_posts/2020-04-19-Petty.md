A good mental model moving from adolescence to adulthood seems to be _don't be petty_.

However:

1. It is hard and goes against our nature. Especially mine as my favorite comedian is Jerry Seinfeld (and Woody Allen is up there too).
2. Petty does not mean small things _are_ unimportant. It means things _of_ small importance.

So, Ted, don't be petty, know that it is not natural, and know what petty really means. Listo.
