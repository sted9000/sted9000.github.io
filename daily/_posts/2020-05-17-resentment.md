Definition of resentment: displeasure or persistent ill will at something regarded as a wrong, insult, or injury.

I am coming to believe that the negativity chained to resentment can be found in a single word of its above definition. Guesses?

"Persistent"

Displeasure and ill will are inevitable. But they are also short-lived and largely inconsequential.

Elderly people are generally adorable. Somehow age has allowed them to hold a better perspective on life than us young-bucks. They are less squirmish, looser, and in some sense freer of restlessness.

However, there is a group of elderly that age has not been kind to. The persistence of resentment has, over time, turned toxic and eaten them up from the inside leaving a void and a tireless anger.

This is very sad.

Aside from showing them love when we can, perhaps the best way to love them is to not allow displeasure and ill will to persist in you.

Write in your journal about your displeasures. Call a loved one and talk about your ill will toward your spouse. Whatever your form of externalizing and expulsing these natural, inevitable, and temporary feelings. Just do it. Avoid the persistence.

That's my plan anyway.
