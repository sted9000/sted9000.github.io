title: Bankroll Management - Theory

Sadly, the boring things are often also the fundamental and important things you need to get correct to succeed. Bankroll management is probably the most boring part of the poker profession, yet it is unquestionably essential. The following is my good faith effort to get bankroll management right (so I don't have to ever utter the words again). It is not overly complicated. However, I don't trust myself enough not to be explicit and systematic about it.

The management of your bankroll can be broken down into three parts: bankroll-liferoll separation, risk-of-ruin, and shot taking. Let's tackle each in turn.

Bankroll-Liferoll Separation:
While single and in my twenties, having a single pile of money labeled 'my roll' was not a problem. To be honest, it was quite nice and simple. When the checking account was running low, withdraw a chunk-of-change big enough not to have to think about real-world-money for the next year or two. Repeat as necessary. Listo.
Now in my thirties, this system no longer works for me. Honestly, I don't know if it is due to a change in temperament or if I can now see the wisdom in compartmentalizing. I will remain agnostic on this point and only focus on the practicalities of separating your 'roll'.
First, you need to know your 'burn' - how much you spend. This takes half an hour with a pen and the back of an envelope.  It doesn't matter what the number is (that's a topic for another time), you just need a decent estimate of how much you spend.
Second, and lastly, you need to withdraw your burn * 1.25 from your bankroll periodically. Your burn goes from your bankroll directly into your liferoll. The other 25% goes into a segregated savings account to pay to Uncle Sam (or, if you are like many poker players and don't pay your taxes, into investments. In the case you were ever audited, you will have the money to pay what you owe and you will sleep better at night). This step, unfortunately, is repetitive. Create a habit of weekly or monthly withdrawing to keep your bankroll and liferoll separate.

Risk-of-Ruin:
While not quite as boring as making an excel sheet of your expenses, dealing with abstract maths is still far from glamorous. The essence of risk-of-ruin is as follows: Poker is simply a long series of small bets, and as such, you always need to make sure you have the capital to place those small bets. If your bets are small and your edge is large you will never go broke. If your bets are large and your edge is small you will certainly go broke. Calibrating your risk-of-ruin means setting up a system that lives between these two extremes.
First, know yourself - your temperament and your goals. Are you risk-averse? Is poker your career, a short-term job, or a hobby? Do you handle swings well, or poorly? Do you have a family to support? Do you want to be a millionaire, or live a more frugal life? Sit down and consider these questions for a few moments - possibly consulting friends, family, or your partner for some clarity.
Second, do the math. [This calculator](http://www.reviewpokerrooms.com/poker-games/general/bankroll-requirements.html) is a great tool. Two things to keep in mind when doing your calculations are your burn and your ability to move down in stakes. A few examples of simple back-of-the-envelope calculations will be in a [following post](""). 
Finally, create a system that incorporates what you gathered from steps one and two. At what levels are you going to move up and move down? Do you need to play more hours to cover your burn if you move down? There is no right or wrong answer here, but there is aligned and misaligned. Match your temperament and your goals with the math.

Shot Taking:
By far the sexiest of the bankroll management trio, shot taking is closely related to both the separation of your bankroll/liferoll and your risk-of-ruin. Furthermore, it is essential to increasing your earning potential, your learning potential, as well as to enjoying the game.
If your bankroll/liferoll is not separate, the background pressure anxiety while shot-taking might be too high. And if you are not good with anxiety you might end up not taking shots at all. Ditto if your risk-of-ruin is too high. This is all to say that shot taking comes after sorting out the first two more boring aspects of bankroll management.
The benefits of shot-taking are large. Moving up a stake/level could potentially double your hourly rate and playing against stiffer competition will surely sharpen your skills. Schedule shots as frequently as possible given your situation. While most shots fail - due to unavoidable variance or lack of an edge - I have yet to take a regrettable shot. At a minimum, I drop back down with new tricks up my sleeve and a regained enthusiasm for the game. And if the shot sticks, bonus.
Systematize most of your shots. Plan in advance the point at with you will take them, set aside the money, and either study or taking a break before starting them. Also, occasionally, take improvised shots. Maybe once per week or month, take one session where you designate one or two buy-ins and sit with the big boys for a session so you don't forget what it feels like to take a shot.

In conclusion, bankroll management is a fundamental skill of a poker player. Get it right by separating your rolls, calibrating your risk-of-ruin, and by appropriately taking shots. If you get these three things right, you can focus your energy on the finer details of this great game and if you're lucky never have to think or utter the word 'bankroll management' again.
