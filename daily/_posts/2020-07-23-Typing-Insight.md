Trying to improve my typing skills has been insightful.

1 - It serves as a reminder of our day-to-day variation in performance. One day will I make very few errors and have a daily average 10wpm higher than my overall average. The next it is as if I have never seen a keyboard. I think this lesson is very applicable to life - for no apparent reason, many aspects of yourself (and others) will vary daily.

2 - It also serves as a reminder that we instinctually focus too much on the outcome and not enough on the process needed to achieve it. This became extremely clear then I changed my strategy from "go go go as fast as you can" to "improving accuracy". Still, my first glance (and my emotional response) after finishing a practice round is at the speed, rather than the accuracy. The big shiny object is distracting me from the process.
