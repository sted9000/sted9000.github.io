I am convinced that following the urge for the latest news, content, and even to some extent ideas is not the best we can do.
My best guess is that the latest news was somehow very important to our tribal ancestors.
But currently we really don't need news at all -
we are not all traders needing the latest information to beat the market, nor does the news tell us anything new about the people interact with.
And while you might argue that consuming the news gives you stuff to talk to with others, so does not consuming it.
"I haven't read the news in a while. What is going on? I am truly interested."

With out any further bullshit preamble here is my reading list for 2019:
