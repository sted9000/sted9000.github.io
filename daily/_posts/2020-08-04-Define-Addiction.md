Here are two definitions of addiction that I have found useful recently. Perhaps they are useful because they illuminate the fact that addiction is much more prevalent in our own lives than we would like to admit. Anywho...

> Addiction is repeated behavior despite adverse consequences.

> Addiction is the narrowing of things you find pleasurable.
