Two ideas that I want to explore from his episode of The Lex Fridman Podcast. 

1. The morning download. When you are sleeping, the brain is hard at work -- taking out the trash and processing ideas from the day before. Taking advantage of this processing that occurred while sleeping is not a foregone conclusion. Allowing a space for the insights to download to conscious thought upon waking, rather than filling your mind with new stimuli is something I want to play with.
1. Getting into _deep work_ is something that I am intrigued by and struggle with. I have been struggling so much that I have begun pleading helplessness. This is not a solution. The three overarching factors to consider are your environment, your level of arousal, and your top-down control. Tweaking the dials and experimenting seems like it could be lots of fun and potentially very meaningful.
