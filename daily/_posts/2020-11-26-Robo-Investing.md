Robo-Investing sounds bland. A bunch of algorithms picking stocks, funds, and indexes for slightly better returns than the average investor. That said, I am starting to find Robo-Investing incredibly sexy.

1. Best practices without needing the expensive education.
1. 50-90% lower fees due to automation.
1. Protecting you from yourself via "set it and forget it".
1. Investing calibrated to your risk level. 
1. "Forced" savings.
1.  High yield savings accounts. 

This is software and automation at its best. Helping us be better humans.
