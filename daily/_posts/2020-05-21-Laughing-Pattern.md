An emerging pattern I am going to keep an eye on is the correlation between laughing at one's own jokes and originality.

I have previously seen laughing at one's own jokes as self-congratulatory and a likely indicator of insanity. But I suppose there could be positive attributes that lead to this behavior as well. Having delight towards an idea or thought and not minding that others see your delight seems both sane and positive. Furthermore, perhaps the positive qualities that lead to laughing at your own jokes also lead towards originality and living by your own rules.
