"Contextural" is my hated word of the month. I watched a video interview with Gary V and now I can't get the 2-second clip of him saying "It's all very contextual, you know what I mean?" out of my mind. 

What I think people mostly mean when they say contextural is 1 - That things change a lot depending on the circumstances and 2 - That things are often a lot more complex than they appear. These are both important things to keep in mind, but for some reason when someone uses the word contextural to answer a question it strikes me as a lazy cop-out for a thoughtful answer. Rather than saying "I don't know" when you don't know, saying "it's very contextural" lets you sound thoughtful without really being so.

I love you Gary V, I ask you kindly to please stop with the contextural bs.
