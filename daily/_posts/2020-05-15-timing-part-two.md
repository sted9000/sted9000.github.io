Every cell in my body is telling me that I am a genius and that I can bathe in the glory or my genius. What a shitty shitty impulse. Besides just being plain wrong, it is petty, smug, and short-sighted, certain to come crashing down to ruins.

This is the precise moment for stoicism. Rather than only turning towards philosophy when you are down and need a strategy to rebuild, why not also use it when you are up and are full of petty ego.

> To have a humble ego, regardless of circumstance.

Not a Marcus Aurelius quote. But could be.
