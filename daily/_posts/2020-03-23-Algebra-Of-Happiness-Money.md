In the Algebra of Happiness, Scott Galloway has a unique and honest perspective regarding finances and wealth. Having been shaped by the experience of his single mother getting cancer and him not being a good position to support her, he makes a strong case for financial security being a necessity.
> We were under-insured, and I didn't have any contacts who were doctors. I felt a rush of emotions, but mostly I wished I had more money and influence. I knew that wealth, among other things, brought contacts and access to a different level of healthcare. We had neither.

He says the idea of 'follow you passion' is bullshit.
> ... people who tell you to follow your passion are already rich.

And rather than choosing a profession based on passion, he acknowledges other darker motives that should inform your choice.
> The rewards and recognition that stem from being great at something will make you passionate about whatever that something is.

He plays high-stakes, funding and founding companies, but also recognizes that rich is relative. Wealth is not only related to your income. It is also related to your _burn_. He says his father is rich, because he collects 50k a year in retirement and spends 40k.
> The definition of 'rich' is having passive income greater than your burn.

> Young people are 100 percent focused on their earnings. Adults also focus on their burn.

And on a comical note (the book is quite funny) he dispels the idea that once you are filthy rich you will relax because you no longer need to worry about finances.
> Wealthy people claim they don't think much about money. That's bullshit -- they are obsessed with money.

Ideas, in my own words, to take to heart: Wealth matters, if not for you than for your loved ones. Passion will come as you get bad-ass-good at anything (the point made by Cal Newport in _So Good They Can't Ignore You_). Who cares if the passion comes from the profession itself or from the fact that you are good at it. If passive income - burn > 0: then you are rich. Don't envy rich people thinking they don't stress about money.
