My girlfriend and dog are peacefully sleeping. Everyone I know is healthy.  No time for blogging because I am having a silly amount of fun with some new node libraries tools in a new IDE.

A few random links:

- [Some of my brother's music](https://soundcloud.com/ryanclarkva/get-lost)
- [My girlfriends new blog](https://mica-92.github.io/addhana/)
- [Thought provoking and impressive discussion on the moment and race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHGt733yw3g)

Until tomorrow, be well.
