title: "Improbable Positive Event"
---

Yesterday I had extended conversations with each of my siblings. A rare gift.

I talk to them each on average of about once every ten - each being an independent event. What are the chances that this would happen any given day?

10^3 - improbable.

What makes this event so dear is knowing that it will certainly recur, on a day where something terrible happens - when someone close to us loses their health or their life - but yesterday was not that day and it was a gift.
