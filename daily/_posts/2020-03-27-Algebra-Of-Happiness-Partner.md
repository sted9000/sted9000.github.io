When not talking about [money](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/23/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Money) or [entrepreneurship](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/25/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Entrepreneur), _[The Algrebra of Happiness](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/21/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Intro)_ touches on partnering - both the importance of picking the right one and some tips for a joyous journey.

First regarding the importance. It is obvious that who you partner with is important, but he claims it is **the most important**.

> The most important decision you'll make is not where you work or who you party with, but who you choose to partner with for the rest of you life.

A few tips from someone who over the course of multiple marriages has learned quite a bit more than I have (to-date):

> Money is an especially important value for alignment, as the number one source of marital acrimony is financial stress.

> Keeping score creates a dynamic where you never give in to the real joy in life... doing something for someone because you love them and choose their happiness over everything else, full stop.

And multiple times he expresses the contrast between partnering poorly and the joys of partnering well.

> Building a life with someone who loves you, and who you love near guarantees a life of reward interrupted by moments of pure joy. Sharing your life with someone who's unstable or has contempt for you is never being able catch your breath long enough to relax and enjoy your blessings.

Ideas to take to heart (in my own words): Pick well or forever hold your peace. Communicate well about financial matters. Fuck keeping score, do things for a higher sake. Joy will be the telltale sign of partnering well.
