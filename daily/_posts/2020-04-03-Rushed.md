I have two underlying feelings that I am trying to get more familiar with. The first is the feeling of _being rushed_.

In many things I do, I have the feeling of needing to be doing it faster, more efficiently, or that I should be doing something else entirely. It sucks sweaty hairy monkey-balls.

My best guess is that it stems from only having a fluffy sense, rather than a solid sense, of goals and meaning in many aspects of life.

I understand that goals and meaning are moving goalposts, but having an idea of where to aim at any particular point in time seems wise.

Bullet Journal here I come.
