Every time I read The Wisdom of Insecurity I take something new away (or perhaps I simply have a poor memory).

This time I am left with a clarified definition of 'spiritual'. Whenever I speak this word I am worriedly looking at my partner in conversation to making sure I do not lose them. To the ardent atheist, it reaks of dogmatism. To the fundamentalist, it implies the supernatural and an afterlife.

Here is my new working definition of spiritual... Negatively: that which is neither concerned with the past or the future and can't be captured in words or ideas. Positively: the uncapturable present.

For some reason, the negative definition works best for me. Strip away the past and future, take what you are left with and subtract all words (silent, mental) and ideas. What remains is what I mean by spiritual.
