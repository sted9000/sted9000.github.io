title: "Claim Victory - Righteous Mind"
---
Grasping on to the ideas that our motivations are often driven by crude intuitions and are often far darker than self-reported has been a 'wowing' ride so far.

A nice example of this with my Claim Victory call on a January Freeroll to cut out meat:
Even from a crude reflection, both my impetus for starting this project and where my satisfaction from accomplishing it are coming from seem obvious.

Rather than wanting to be good prompting me to action, selfishly social motives boosted me up on this wagon / soapbox.

And rather than being satisfied by doing good (eating less meat for a month), I am strangely satisfied by moral righteousness and a hi-mindedness.

Many steps ahead on the road to character I guess...
