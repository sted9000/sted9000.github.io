Only now, a decade into my profession am I beginning to embrace it fully. I have been blowing smoke for a long time whenever asked me about my profession. "No no no, I am not a gambler. I am a poker player. Think of it like chess with a bit more psychology" I would say trying to avoid them thinking that I was a degenerate or worse - that I was a naive kid on a hot streak.

Today I find a perverse joy is calling myself a professional gambler. I don't much care if people think that I am a degenerate (because I have come to know that I am not. I am actually extremely risk averse and seek tranquility over excitement). In my mind, a professional gambler is striving towards courage, elegance, and mental clarity without giving two shits about appearances. These traits of a professional gambler in my mind are noble.

Back to the action.
