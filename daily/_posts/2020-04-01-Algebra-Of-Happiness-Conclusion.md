[The Algebra of Happiness](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/21/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Intro) is all over the place - investing, career choice, death, relationships. So I will close this series with some all over the place quotes that didn't fit in the other posts.

Balance is not an option if you want to be in the top echelon of financial earners or founders.

> But if balance is your priority in your youth, then you need to accept that unless you are a genius, you may not reach the upper rungs of economic security.

He agrees with me...

> Writing is my therapy. It's a way for this shit banging around in my head to find an escape route.

Stop acting like adults only at certain times

> It shocks me how many people are the adults in the room until they get around their parents and regress into whiny children expecting their parents to solve their problems.

Failure is going to happen if you are doing the entrepreneur thing correctly. Pick your spots wisely.

> I've founded, or co-founded, nine firms. The factor most strongly correlated to success or failure? When they were started. (best time is coming out of a recessions)

Crying as a signal.

> Crying may have an evolutionary purpose, as it signals surrender ("please stop what you are doing to me").

_Adopt_ a kid?

> The fastest blue-line path to a better world isn't economic growth or a better fucking phone, but more of us becoming irrationally passionate about the well-being of a child who isn't our own.

I very much enjoyed the book. His bluntness and honesty about his faults and blunders was refreshing. If nothing else he seems authentic, but I would bet that his nuggets highlighted in this series will add (perhaps even multiply) value to parts of my life.
