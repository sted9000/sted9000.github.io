Before, my ill-will and harsh speech towards him was a bit performative and limited to intellectual and philosophical disagreement. Now I am angry. Given a chance, I would give him a piece of my mind.

We are going to stay with my grandfather in a few weeks time. The guilt I feel going into a store -- knowing that every unnecessary outing is putting my grandfather's life at risk -- makes me angry. The fact that I will be forgoing my daily cup of decaf for the next 14 days, that my girlfriend will be forgoing social gatherings, and that I will still feel scared when I enter my grandfather's house makes me angry. 

All this death, seclusion, despair, and anger might well have been avoided if the man had been competent, courageous, or slightly caring.
