Competent professionals are 'the nuts'. They make your day and make the world go round - while at the same time making it look easy. I went to get two vaccines yesterday (meaning I had to exit the house and interact with other humans face-to-face) and it was wonderful to be attended to by competent professionals.

One effect of the way we consume news now is that we are shown examples of incompetence more frequently than before. On this point
I am not going to jump on the 'bash the media' bandwagon. Being shown incompetence, at least in my case, produces the urge to be competent myself and gratitude for the competent professionals that we have administering vaccines at CVS.

Long live competent professionals.
