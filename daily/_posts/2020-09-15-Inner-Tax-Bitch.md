The idea that we all have an "inner bitch" has been proving useful as of late. Self-explanatory, it is the voice in your head that sounds like a bitch. "But I don't want to", "Start tomorrow", etc. The bitch will never go away, and it is our job to continually kill it.

In honor of my inner bitch (I should give it a proper name) and its current tenacity, I want to propose a freeroll here: I must work on my taxes for at least 15minutes every weekday until they are finished. Reward: 1ETH.

Freeroll goes to the first reader to contact me. RIP inner tax bitch and have a wonderful day.
