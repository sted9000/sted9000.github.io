[Trustory](https://www.trustory.io/) is a platform in development that is aiming to be a truth layer on the internet.
In [this discussion thread](https://discourse.trustory.io/t/will-trustory-teach-me-how-to-think/233) members were talking about thinking.
This is what I took away.

> "... I’m realizing is that it is much, much easier to teach someone how to think than to teach them to TO think." - priyatham

> "...it is important to remember that we learn not only by reading new information, but also by doing things." - jsrubin

> "If information was once the grist for ideas, over the last decade it has become competition for them — we have started to prefer knowing things over thinking because knowing has more immediate value..." - Pam (quoting David Friedburg)

All great points that I want to think more about.

The first and third quotes point to a distinction that I often overlook: knowing is a adjective while thinking is a verb and one is not a replacement for the other.
The second reminds me that thinking is a process and a skill that can be learned by doing it, not only by studying about it.
