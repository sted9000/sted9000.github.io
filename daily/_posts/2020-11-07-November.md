Brain fried. Battery on one bar. Gratitude plenty.

- Cars, highways, and Dunkin Doughnuts. There is nothing better than hitting the open road with a freshly brewed coffee and a blueberry cake doughnut on a beautiful fall day.
- Twitter. I now follow around five people. They are all kinder, thoughtful, wiser, and more productive than I am. It is a free firehose of inspiration.
- Not thinking about politics tomorrow.
- Honest friends. 

Be well.
