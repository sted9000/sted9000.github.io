title: Data Project - First Pass

I have been thinking about different rake, bonuses, sites, and game structures lately. These are the boring parts of poker, but to thrive while playing you should have all these ducks in a row. As it turns out, these seemingly simple parts of the game of poker are not so simple when you really take a look at them.

Here is a first pass at some data from my play for the last two weeks.

Sites now-a-days are very closed about how much they are charging to run the games. In the past a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation with the information the sites provided would do the trick. Now, with little information, it looks like a little more data processing is needed.

- Blue = Gross
- Orange = Gross - Rake
- Green = Gross - Rake + Rakeback
- Pink = Gross - Rake + Rakeback + Bonuses

It is going to be a fun project figuring out all this stuff, but I am already looking forward to it being over.
