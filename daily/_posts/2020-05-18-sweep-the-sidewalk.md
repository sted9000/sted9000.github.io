title: Sweeping the Sidewalk
tags: wisdom

Every Monday morning here in Buenos Aires the apartment building managers are out sweeping the sidewalk in front of their buildings.

This quarantine has again revealed the wisdom of Groundhog's Day - our lives are repetitive, it is how we engage with this repetition that matters. Repetition itself is not the problem.

The question then becomes: How do I sweep the sidewalks of my life? How engaged am I with the repetitive and mundane tasks?

I know this is a cliche observation, but I like the notion that cliches contain wisdom... That's how they became cliches.
