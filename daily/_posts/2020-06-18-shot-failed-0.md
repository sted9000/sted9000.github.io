title: Shot Failed I

My mission to higher stakes poker that launched a few weeks ago has officially crashed. And while no team of experts needs to be assembled do diagnose the cause of the crash and assign responsibility, I would like to reflect on the failed mission for a few sentences to hopefully learn something useful (that we can incorporate into the next launch attempt).

To start on a positive note, we had plenty of fuel. 10 buy-ins, while not enough to overcome even one standard deviation of poor variance, is about right. Much more would just weigh down the vessel and much less would not even get you off the ground.

More tomorrow...
