A concept that I heard yesterday: When we see inequality, we have only two instinctual instruments to make sense of it. The first is personal blame and responsibility. The second is to place the blame on the system at large (thus leaving the individual as a victim).

With that being the case, the anti-racist movement is more explainable. People are choosing the more compassionate of the two explanations. Fortunately (because it is part of what makes life so beautiful), yet at times like this frustratingly, the world and solutions to its problems are a bit more complicated.
