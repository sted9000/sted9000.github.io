While [the book](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/21/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Intro) touches a broad array of topics, a common anchor is relationships. They are the reason we work and strive professionally.

> Professional success is the means, not the end. The end is economic security for your family, and more important, meaningful relationships with family and friends.

> Achievement is just a moment in pencil unless you can share it with people you care about. Then it becomes real, a memory in permanent ink.

The author also parrots the truism that experiences are more precious than objects. I suspect that many in his world of finance and b-school tend to forget this from time to time.

> Invest in experiences over things. Drive a Hyundai, and take your wife to St. Bart's.

And towards the end of the book in what seemed very heartfelt, he urges us to tell the people we care about that we care about them rather than let the small voice in our head that tell us that it is too sentimental block the message.

> We have an even greater reservoir of admiration and good thoughts about others that get caught in the filters of insecurity and fear. To not let that dam burst is to cut life short and shortchange joy.

Ideas to take to heart (in my own words): Finances = Means; Relationships = Ends. St. Barts > Hyundai. Don't let sounding silly stop you from communicating from the heart with those whom you care about.
