The next step of the GTD System is **process**. You have [captured](https://sted9000.github.io/blog/2020/02/02/GTD-Capture.html) everything that came across your mind, now it is time to ask _what is it and what do I want to do about it?_

Ideas, worries, and thoughts that you have captured may not have come to you in a very clear or intelligible form. The start of processing is to make clear what the items you have captured are.

Next, ask and answer the question of _what do I want to do about it?_ Here we apply a few conditionals as this can be a big and complicated question:

The first conditional is _is it actionable?_ Is there a physical action to take to move it forward? Categories of items with the response of _no, this is not actionable_ are: **trash**, **reference materials**, **someday-maybe**, and a **reminders/later**. If it is actionable, the next conditional is _can it be done in less than 2 minutes?_ If yes, do it; if no, apply a length conditional of _is it more than one step?_ If yes, this item has now just became a project (congratulations) and goes on your **Projects List**; if only one step, ask _what is the physical action required to move this item to completion?_ and add your response to a list named **Next Actions**

Don't worry, all bold text above will be explained in further detail in later parts of this series and hopefully will be come clear and usable, but this is it for **process**. By asking _what is it and what do I want to do about it?_ you moved what you had already captured towards being where it needs to be to get done, and one step further to actually getting done :)
