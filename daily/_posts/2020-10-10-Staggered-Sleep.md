My girlfriend and I have been on different pages lately and too often not kind or pleasant to the other. It is not always roses.

I think being on different sleep schedules has helped us get through this little rough patch.

Due to work, I changed my schedule and am now waking three hours after my girlfriend and going to sleep a few hours after she has already passed out for the night. I believe the consequences of this staggered schedule are two-fold. One, each of us gets a little alone and quiet time every day. During times of quarantine, alone time is rare and cherished. Two, we are never both in mind-states that are conducive to being a dick (me) or being bitchy (her). Namely, grogginess in the morning and exhaustion towards the end of the night. When you have two imperfect humans in less than optimal states of mind, civility and good humor is, at times, hard to find.

An unexpected solution to one of life's little puzzles.
