title: Productivity - Live Templates
tags: productivity

Improving my typing speeds to a reasonable level (from 50wpm to 75wpm) has been a boost in productivity while coding. I am now focusing on a new tool called Live Templates - smart programmable auto-completes.

How many times have I, a novice programmer, written a Python for-loop? Thousands for sure. Why type it out repeatedly in full when a shortcut exists. 

for item in items:

Typing that line of code takes 20 key-strokes. Live templates allow you to do it in 12 key-strokes. A 40% increase. Very cool. 

And I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg with live templates. Larger code-blocks that have a lot of boiler-plate code and predictable variable names are ripe for the picking.
