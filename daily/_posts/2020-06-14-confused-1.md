Part of my confusion with this moment was concerning racism and its pervasiveness. However, now, I don't think racism is the issue to be focused on - I believe inequality is.

Is the police a racist organization? That is a fair question given our history. But the data doesn't seem to suggest that it is. What the data does show is deep and lasting inequalities based upon race. This is unfair. This is the issue to be grappled with.

What policies are leading to this inequality? Tax deductions on home interest, underfunding of poor school districts, taxing capital at a lower rate than labor income, and the relics of the failed war on drugs are all policies that are plausibly leading to inequality. Calling them racist policies is missing the point.
