Shame: A painful emotion caused by the awareness of having done something wrong or foolish.

How much of one's mental software is dedicated to shame? If one were shameless, how would one's mental life differ?

The honest answer is I don't know. But do have an idea. During adolescence, my mental shame module was running almost all of the time. Today I think I can say that it is running less. Better, but nowhere close to being shameless.

I am hesitant to say that we should aim to be shameless because of the model we have living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. But I think that is right. Shame is not our only compass and I fail to call to mind any experience where shame (or fear of it) has guided me in the correct direction. I would like to think that a cocktail of kindness, empathy, and curiosity is a perfect substitute for shame.

How does one become less concerned with shame? And how does shamelessness look and feel in someone who also has an adequate moral compass?
