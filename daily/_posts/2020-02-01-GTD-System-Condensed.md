title: "My Personal Management System – Part 2 - The System (condensed)"

In one longish sentence here it is:
> "We (1) capture what has our attention, (2) clarify what each item means and what to do about it, (3) organize the result, which present the options we (4) reflect on, which we then choose to (5) engage with." - GTD

1 - Write down what is on your mind as it comes up. Whatever it is. Make sure it is in a place you trust you will come back too.

2 - Routinely clarify all the items. Ask what do the things you have written down mean?

3 - After clarified, place all the items where they belong.

4 - When the items are where they belong you can then reflect on them.

5 - Engage.

One important point is that the system works best when done as a whole coherent system - the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Each of the steps have interesting details and ideas for how best to implement them (we will explore them in the following parts of this series), but as you can see the overarching system is simple: Get your thoughts out of your head, figure out what they mean, put them where they belong, decide what to do, get things done.
