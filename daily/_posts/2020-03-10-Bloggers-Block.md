For the first time on this blogging adventure I have run in to the thought _I don't know what to write about today_. It makes me feel boring and shallow.

I think of friends whom seem to have a much richer and interesting life with a multitude of friends, projects, and aspirations. Surely they have infinite things to write about.

Truly my life is very routinized and repetitive from a birds-eye-view. However, on the inside each routine has it's small variations that are the source of richness. And each repetition feels like it is slowly leading to a new and beautiful place.

A _problem_ is that I don't have the language abilities to express this _richness_ without sounding hokey, woo-wooie, or off my rocker insane. But I suppose that is part of this adventure, to gain this ability.
