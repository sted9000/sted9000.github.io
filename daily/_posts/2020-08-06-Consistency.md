title: Consistency

The Joe Rogan Experience has over 1500 episodes. This blog has recently passed 200 (consecutive) posts and I have developed a great appreciation for consistency. I find that being able to pound away at anything, day after day, month after month, is impressive and not trivial. You need to have either a good process or proper motivation to be consistent. My journey started with good motivation and has transitioned to a good process because I have learned that I cannot rely on motivation. I am a lazy piece of shit. Here is to the next 1300. Cheers.
