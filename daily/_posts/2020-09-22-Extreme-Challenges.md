The benefits of challenges such as a 5-day fast, running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours, or playing 60 hours of poker in six days are not obvious while the downsides are. I think this is because the benefits are psychologic and longer-term, while the downsides are tangible and immediate.

These qualities make doing the cost-benefit analysis impossible for anyone not doing or being experienced with a similar challenge. My take, after ticking off a few less-extreme extreme challenges, is that as long as you keep your costs reasonable and temporary (ie don't go broke and don't break your body) the benefits, however nebulous, are worth it.
