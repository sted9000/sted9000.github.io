To the extent that there is a conceptual intent in my spiritual life it might be this: a sense of wellbeing regardless of circumstance.

A problem however is that this goal is both easy and difficult to measure.

It is easy because you can be directly aware of your wellbeing in any circumstance. A truly honest answer to "what is it like to be me right now?" gives you the perfect measure instantly and without any intermediary.

It is difficult because the question of "what is it like to be me right now?" can seem to be an overloaded one. Multiple threads, projects, time, and relationships all crisscrossing and condensed to this moment of being me.  How do you even begin to answer that question honestly?

Every once in a while you get some external hints about your wellbeing. But generally the task of measuring this goal is a solitary one.

This post has no outcome. Just thinking on the page.

Have a wonderful day.
