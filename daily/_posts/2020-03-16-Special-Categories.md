title: "Special Categories"
---

Never missing a chance to think that I am special, today I thought _I am so lucky to have a lot of people in my life that defy categorization. Neither friend nor family is a sufficient word._

While this thought is so silly and obvious to rightfully be called absurd, I would like to think that the underlying sentiment is not too hokey.

The sentiment has to do with the fact that the categories of friends and family both are essentially infinite. Within each group you can have such varying relationships and characters. And that while if you asked me "well, is he a friend or a part of your family?" I could answer you, that answer is so zoomed out that it looses most of it's beauty.
