title: Education - Programming Fun
tags: education

Programming is getting more fun. I am a very slow learner, but I can see progress. The two areas of growth lately have been: 
- Smarter reading of documentation
- Understanding when I am stuck sooner
- Making better choices between hacking away and learning a new pattern

And this progress is all-the-more fun because the list of technologies I am eager to learn is growing:
- TailwindCSS
- React/Vue
- Fastai

Hopefully, I can wrap my head around these three by this time in 2021.
