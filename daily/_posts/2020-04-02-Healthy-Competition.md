My lovely partner has started sitting down to meditate on a regular basis. This produced a unique feeling. This feeling probably has a name, but I do not know it.

Competition is not the right word. In no way did I feel like one-upping her.

Motivation is not right either. Her sitting down didn't make me want to sit down. Rather told me I could.

Inspiration is closer, but still not quite right. It implies a spark and ignition. Here there was only a question.

I know her restlessness and yet she was still sitting down. I am restless. Could I sit down too?
