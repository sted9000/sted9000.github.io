I have been thinking a lot about this new chapter in life. While not much has changed other than the location, I am treating this moment as a stopping point. I am attempting to zoom out and in with the tools that I have to evaluate what should come next - what projects to pay attention to - and how to best pursue them.

An idea that I caught from one the 80,000 Hours founders is that rather than spending .01-1% of your time deciding what you should do and the rest doing it, perhaps you should spend 1-10% of your time deciding. The hope is that the 10% of the time you 'wasted' deciding is worth its weight in gold if you end up making a wise decision. It doesn't even have to be accurate (being correct in your decision); for the 80,000 Hours calculus to pay off you simply need to start in a better direction than you would have by rushing into things.
