> ...I might be tempted to envy people who can live that way, except that I do not think they have any fewer nightmares than I do. Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the willfully unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid. 

An interesting thought from J.K Rowling. She is talking about people with a lack of imagination. But she is not talking about imagination in the traditional fantasy-writer-way. She is talking about putting yourself in another's shoes - empathy. Positing that people with a poverty of this type of imagination are not spared troubles, worry, or nightmares as you might think they would be by living in a safer and protected mental universe. 

This rings true. I know many (myself included) who have chosen the safer and less imaginative route and who have not been spared nightmares. And if this is the case -- if Rowling is correct -- what is the upside to being unimaginative?
