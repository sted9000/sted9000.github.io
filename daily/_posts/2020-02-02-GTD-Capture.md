Now we will get into the details...

The first step of **capture** is relatively straight forward: physically put what is on your mind, somewhere.

Only a few things to say here:

- It doesn't matter what your _capture device_ is. Digital or analog, whatever works for you.
- Use as many capture devices as necessary but as few as possible.
- This is not a _to-do-list_, it is simply a way to capture what is on your mind.
- Trust is the key here. You need to trust you will have all the items that were on your mind when it is time to process. The idea is that this trust facilitates a free, non-distracted, and productive state of mind.

In part 4 we will discuss what in my opinion is the most novel and non-intuitive step in the system: process.
