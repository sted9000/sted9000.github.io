The beginning of adding new tools to your toolbelt is exciting and easy. You see the cool things that the tools help build and you get excited. Buying' the tools is as easy as `$ apt install <cool-new-tool>`.

I am in the process of adding [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) and [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). The excitement has come, the tools have been bought, now time to roll up my sleeves.
