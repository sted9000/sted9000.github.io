title: Neighborly Reminder

One thing I will miss about our neighborhood is the reminder of how lucky I am. There are multiple schools for disabled kids and many therapy centers within a few block radius of our apartment. Each day walking on the street you see someone (with a caregiver) who is living a life very different from our own. It is hard to look at and think about. I am ashamed to say that in the two years I lived here, I never once mustered the will or empathy to be of any service. I was too caught up with Ted. These kids reminded me how wonderful it is to be a healthy and fully formed human. I will miss this reminder from my neighbors.
