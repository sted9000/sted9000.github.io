An interesting potential bet/freeroll that I am thinking about embarking on: How many 8.5 hours of sleep nights can I obtain in a year. Now that we have decent bio-tracking devices a bet like this is possible. At first glance, it seems trivial (as I don't have a job or children). But I think the line is well under 365. Factoring in the monkey mind and its propensity to rebel, forget, and chase the new shiny object, the line might be around 200. 

A full year of "sleeping in" might be a life-changing experience; it might be torture; it might be difficult. One thing is for sure - it would be memorable.
