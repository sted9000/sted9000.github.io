I have two underlying feelings that I am trying to get more familiar with. The first is the feeling of being [rushed](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/04/03/Rushed). The second is the feeling of _filling in the blanks_.

Seth Godin had a [blog](https://seths.blog/2020/03/fill-in-the-blanks-2/) recently that resonated with this feeling I have been noticing. Tests normally come in one of three flavors - multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and essay. You can apply these methods to life - the test.

Picking from a bank of four standard and pre-selected choices is too easy to be meaningful. Placing the correct word in the blank implies that someone else already knew the answer and is just seeing if you read the textbook. Essays therefore are the way to go. They require thought, structure, creativity, effort, and pause.

Life -> Test; Format -> Essay.
