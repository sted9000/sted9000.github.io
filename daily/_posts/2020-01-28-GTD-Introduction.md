title: "My Personal Management System – Introduction"
---

Let’s start with the question “why have a personal management system?” The silly answer is that we all already have one whether we acknowledge it or not. So I guess then the real question is “why have a _structured_ personal management system?”

I never bothered to explore this question. If asked I would have responded with something along the lines of: “Passion for my projects, my mindfulness practice, and quality thinking about both high level and low level problems is better than any structured system. Sure some ways of doing things are better than others but _Structured Management System_ sounds like a marketing gimmick from consultants and self-help authors.”

My mind has recently been changed by the David Allen, author of _Getting Things Done_. I am now semi-certain that a door to a more productive life has been opened...

… and that is great; being productive is good because it helps us obtain the objects of our desires – from mundane crap to meaningful opportunities for ourselves and our families and everything in-between. But what is even more exciting is that I am now curiously optimistic that a Structured Personal Management System is a condition to more than than productivity – to joy, creativity and a quieter more compassionate mind.

That seems like a fine answer to “why have a structured personal management system?”

In part one we will start by looking at the philosophies behind the system.
