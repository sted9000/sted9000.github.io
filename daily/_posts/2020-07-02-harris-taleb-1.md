The two biggest living influences on my 'intellectual life' and how I think are NN Taleb and Sam Harris. NN Taleb's Fooled by Randomness was one of my first reads out of university and still greatly influences the way I see the world. I also read his book of aphorisms at least twice a year. Harris is the clearest thinker in the world and his books and podcast have introduced me to ideas ranging from existential risk to spirituality.

I would love to get these two men in a room and play a moderator. However, it seems unlikely to happen in this lifetime because...

...each seems to detest the other.

It's a strange world. How can my heroes not like each other?

Today I will leave you with a passage from Harris describing Taleb, but in the future, I want to explore why these two are at such odds and see if I can't develop a master plan to get them in the same room or on a podcast with each other.

> I know may of you love this guy and think he's a genius. I can assure you, none among you are as impressed with his intelligence as he is. This guy is just insufferable, and he's a bully, and most of the time doesn't make any sense. And never knows it. I've actually never witnessed a marriage of incompetence and confidence so fully and grotesquely consummated in the mind of a person with a public platform. This is the most arrogant person I've ever had the misfortune of meeting...

> When you meet him, you quickly discover that he radiates a sense of grievance from his pores in a way that few people do. It's kind of like a preternatural force of negative charisma, and he can convey his contempt for everyone at the table, even in the way he says "pass the salt". He is so convinced that his genius has not been appropriately lauded that he finds some way to communicate this in almost every interaction. He is a child in a man's body, and the mismatch between his estimation of himself and the quality of his utterances is so complete and so mortifying to witness in person that you're just jumping out of your skin.
