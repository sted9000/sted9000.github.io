I have had a crazy week with a mix of new (city, apartment, job) and old (reuniting with family). And what is putting a smile on my face today is that the future seems to be much like this past week - a mix of both new and old. New friends and the same great old ones. New routines and the same great parts of the old ones. New members of the family and the same great old ones.
