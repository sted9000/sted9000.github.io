My professional life has been 99.9% solo. Being a soloist has many advantages:
- Nothing arbitrary
- Keep all the upside
- You decide priorities
- Ability to focus
- No bullshit

However, there is one downside that I am coming to appreciate more and more: no network of peers. I think that I have greatly under-estimated this network because you can't see or hold the benefits. Perhaps it is the way information travels in this network. Or maybe it has more to do with motivation and connection. I am not sure about the mechanisms, but I am looking for ways to capture the benefits of a network of peers in my non-traditional profession.
So far I have been exploring coaching. More on that tomorrow...
