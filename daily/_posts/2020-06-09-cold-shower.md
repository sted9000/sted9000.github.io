Cold exposure is all the rage in today's Instagram pop-health scene (I know because I follow it). There are supposed physiological health benefits ranging from improved insulin response to alleviating chronic depression. Here, however, I would like to make a more philosophical argument for cold showers.

1. Dead = Bad; Opposite of Dead = Alive; Cold Shower = Very Alive.
1. Overcoming small worries, consistently (because you don't adapt and normalize to cold showers in the way I thought you would), might give you the courage to overcome other small worries in life. Every time you go from standing behind the shower stream to jumping under it, you get to experience the transition from apprehension to the reality of the thing you were apprehensive about and see 'that was not so bad'. You jumped in and you survived.
1. The intensity of the cold sensation drowns everything else out. No coronavirus, no frustrations, no politics, no money, no work. Just intensity. And then when you step out you have remembered that the petty stuff is not all there is.
1. Rather than taking warm showers for granted, you became grateful for them.
