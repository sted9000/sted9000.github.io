title: Shot Failed II

One thing I re-learned during this failed shot is the wide range of mental states that I am capable of bringing to the tables. As I wrote about when the shot first started, my mind was super-focused, engaged, and open to new thoughts and ideas. From that end of the spectrum all the way down to distracted, disengaged, and unwilling to entertain new ideas is a long ways. That said, I experienced them both in this shot and it makes me think that there is much room for improvement in the 'mental engagement' aspect of my professional life. This is nice as I have always been drawn to improving my mental-game. Something to work on before next shot.

Be well, until tomorrow...
