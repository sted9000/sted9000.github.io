Every poker situation has one (or many) optimal solution. When playing, you are trying to implement the optimal solution. At times, this is difficult because between you and the optimal solution lay many things. These things include but are not limited to: clear thinking, low levels of attachment, access to unconscious skills, noticing rapidly incoming cues, basic math, and pattern recognition. All things being equal, you constantly strive towards the optimal solution.

Things are not always equal...

You have been playing all day and are tired or bored. Your dog is lying on your foot, so you can't move, and are physically uncomfortable. You are frustrated at your partner or can't stop thinking about a problem your sibling has regarding work.

In these situation poker teaches you to take the ‘low variance line’. The low variance line is one that achieves almost the same level result without nearly the overhead and complexity. You are sacrificing a little bit of the outcome to make the process a lot easier.

This happens in life too. There are many circumstances when strive for the optimal outcome is the best move. When you are frustrated with your partner and tired, the optimal move work out your issue as soon as possible. The low variance line is to say “Amor, remind me that I have something I want to talk to you about tomorrow” and then go to bed. The optimal move when you have a decision is to work through the process together and come to a consensus. The low variance line when you are moving to another country and know that you have countless decisions to make in the next month is to only work for consensus on the big things and delegate the rest.

I suppose what this low variance line is pointing out is that there is vastly more to life than can be captured in the word optimal.
