_I Moved Your Cheese_ is a very different sort of book that tickles me every time I read it. It is about three mice in a maze. 

In high school, after maximum procrastination, I had to turn in a report in a book the very next day. _Who Moved My Cheese_ was the smallest book on my dad's shelf. I simply wanted to get through it so that I could write a mediocre report as to not draw any attention from the teacher. 

However, the book turned out to be my first exploration into philosophy. It spelled out the world in terms that I understood and imparted a message that sounded like it would help me: Why question the rules of the game? Why waste energy fighting them? Focus only on what you can control. You will be better off.

I forgot about the book completely.

A decade later while backpacking around India, I stumbled across _I Moved Your Cheese_ on a used book cart. I picked it assuming it was a misprint or knock-off of the book I read in high school. But it was not. It was a rebuttal of the best-selling _Who Moved My Cheese_ by a Harvard Business School Professor and it made me smile all the way through.

In the same style that the original was written, the author creates a story that transcends the message of "why question the rules of the game". 

Both books are worth a read.

"You see Max, the problem is not that the mouse is in the maze, but that the maze is in the mouse".
