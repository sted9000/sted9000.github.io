I came across a mental model this week that has me thinking new thoughts and re-thinking ones. It is about the connection and weight between ideas and execution. How much is an idea worth? Is it all about execution?

Here is the model: An idea is only a multiplier of the value of execution. Idea * Execution = Outcome

This formula still is fuzzy on the weighting of ideas and execution, but points out that an idea alone is worthless (as x * 0 = 0). While great execution of anything is worth something, because by default an idea was attached to it (1,000,000 * 1 = 1,000,000).

I find this concept to be a helpful reminder that building is almost always better than coming up with new ideas and that leading is almost always better than philosophizing.
