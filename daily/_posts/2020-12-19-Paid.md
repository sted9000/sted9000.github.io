My election bet paid out yesterday. The whole thing was a nice confluence of good friends who helped me think out-loud, a bit more courage than I am used to mustering, a few mathematical models, and lady luck. 

I am looking forward to more of these types of activities in the future. They bring forth a radical self-doubt that is fun to work through. Perhaps one day I might even have a statistically relevant sample of wagers to hang my hat on.
