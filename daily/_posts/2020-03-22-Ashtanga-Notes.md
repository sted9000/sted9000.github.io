- Emphasis on the breathing over the perfection of the physical form.
- Physical discomfort is a big part of the practice, but you should never experience pain in your joints.
- Use the breath and the point you rest your eyes (drishti) as tools to help you develop concentration during your practice.

> The body's wisdom lies in it's pervasive truthfulness, and the yogi's wisdom lies in the willingness to listen tot h body's sometimes superior sense of itself.

- This form of yoga instructs you to practice 6 days a week. A lot. However it is a 'non-guided' and you repeat the same movements daily you can go at your own pace and level depending on how your body is feeling.

- Learning to constantly accept physical pains and not instinctively turn away. Finding the space between the stimulus and the response.

- Like other physical skills, there are no shortcuts.

- A definition of yoga: The process by which the impossible becomes possible and the possible over a long period of time becomes easy.

- Another definition of yoga: The ability to maintain a singular point of attention.
