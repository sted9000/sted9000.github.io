I would like to believe that a good rule of thumb would be "believe people when they tell you something about themselves". That said, I know most of the noises I make regarding myself, if taken literally, fall squarely in the bull-shit category of noises.

One of my favorite examples is a NN Taleb aphorism.

> When they say "I will never forgive your" they have already begun to forgive you.

An example from my speech recently.

> I like the fact that I have x reaction when y happens.

Translates to, I _wish_ I had the x reaction when y happens. Not so much a lie as self-deception.

An example from my partner recently.

> I have already accepted x.

Translates to, I have _just begun_ to accept x, it is not easy. Not so much a lie as a positive affirmation.

So my tentative conclusion is that reading between the lines is not always a fool's errand. There is some room for it if done skillfully.
