title: Outsourcing the Hard Parts

I heard an enticing idea recently... "I have a bunch of friends that I outsource the hard parts of my life too." - Malcolm Gladwell

Not in the sense of dumping work on friends, but in the sense of allowing friends' obsessions, talents, and insights to take root in your life as well.

This connects closely with the idea that "we are standing on the shoulder of giants". Recognizing that we don't have to learn how to grind flower or bake bread to create a great grilled cheese provokes gratitude.

And then realizing that some of your friends have insights or have figured systems to tackle the hard parts of life is marvelous.
