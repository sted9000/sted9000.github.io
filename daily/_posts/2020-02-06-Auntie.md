I met my grandaunt when she was in her mid eighties and I was in my mid twenties. It was completely refreshing. Still needing to shed my adolescence defensive shell, I was struck by her lack of one. Needing a positive model of the elderly, she listened, smiled, and laughed like I had never imagined.

Although we only spent a few dozen hours together in these past years, I would like to think we got to know each other well in the time allotted.

I regret thinking it too silly to mail order her more Oreo cookies than she could fit in her kitchen. I regret not savoring the last gentle hug a bit more.
