The other day my girlfriend have me take a _strengths test_. The results fit with other personality tests that I have taken in the past. Only this time the the language was a bit more direct.

Top strength - Honesty; Lowest strength (aka weakness) - Bravery. An Honest Coward.

What a bad combination. To see things as they truly are - Great. To see things as they truly are and not have the courage to act on those truths - A Curse. 

So the ideas is that I need to put systems in place to temper my cowardliness. Freerolls, experiments, scheduled attempts to move up the professional ranks, etc.

If I am going to be a Honest Coward, might as well show off my cowardliness with some smarts and panache.
