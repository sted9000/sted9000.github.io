[Penn Jellette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Jillette)... What an interesting man.

1. Way out there, yet somehow sane ideas. Like _tolerance is condescending_.
2. Was _homeless_ by choice.
3. Extreme passivist.
4. Journals religiously.
5. Outspoken atheist.
5. Laughs at his own jokes.
6. Addictive personality but has never touched drugs or alcohol.

I like this man.

This post was inspired by [his appearance](https://podcastnotes.org/tim-ferris-show/penn-jillette-tim-ferriss-street-performing-weight-loss/) on The Tim Ferriss Show.
