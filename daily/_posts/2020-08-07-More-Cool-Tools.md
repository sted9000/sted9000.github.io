[Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) is where I have been honing my typing skills. It is near perfect. The interface is great, the data is beautiful, and the thoughtfulness behind it is evident. If you are thinking about improving your typing skills (and you should be), I would highly recommend it.

[750 Words](https://750words.com/) is a place for morning pages - a popular journaling and creativity writing habit. The site is, again, very thoughtful. It has one purpose and does it well. The page scrolls as you fill your three pages of text. It helps you build a habit with simple rewards. And it inspires playfulness with its fun interface. If you are a morning pages person (and you should be), give it a try.
