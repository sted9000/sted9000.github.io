This morning it seems clear to me the one thing that most people in my life need (and that I need more of myself): the ability to drop worry, stress, and anxiety at a moments notice and see what beautiful lives we all have. We have everything and yet at times, we are utterly miserable.

I know how smug this sounds, but I believe deeply that it is the message that most of us need to have pounded into our heads over and over until we believe it - we can drop the worry, stress, and anxiety at any moment.

The practices exist. Go for a run. Take a cold shower. Throw the shitty people out of our lives. Accept fully the people you choose to keep in your life. Read a book. Go to a counselor. Call a true friend...

I am not saying that it is easy. It surely isn't. But I have faith in us.
