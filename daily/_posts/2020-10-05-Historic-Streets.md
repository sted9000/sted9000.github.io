Running today through the streets of Philadelphia, I found myself in the old city for the first time in my adult life. The current moment of doom and gloom is causing many to lose faith in our government and our country. I feel it. But the forgotten vocabulary etched in stone (such as justice, liberty, and tyranny), Independence Hall, and the Liberty Bell gave me a sense of optimism and pride in our country today. While most of the public face in government seem to be less than admirable, the values our country was founded upon seem to have remained admirable to this day.

It was quite wonderful to think of all the history beneath my feet.
