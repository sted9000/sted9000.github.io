One reason it is nice to go back and read your old journals to see if you are stuck. If you are still having the same category of problem today as you wrote about in a journal a year ago, something needs to change. Problems that have been lingering around for this long are demoralizing to you and sad to caring observers. Why would you want to spend your precious time feeling dizzy - going around and around?

This round-about has many off-ramps and there is no fog beyond the windshield.
