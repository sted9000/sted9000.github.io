In large part the book is directed towards aspiring entrepreneurs or business-school students (a relevant topic given his [background](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/21/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Intro)). The author, Scott Galloway, has a lot to say about what separates success from failure, but starts off on a humble note.  

> The truth about 90+% of entrepreneurs is that we start companies not because we're so skilled, but because we don't have the skills to be an effective employee.

On to his recipe for success.

> Successful entrepreneurs checklist: 1 - Can you sign the front, not the back, of checks? 2 - Are you comfortable with public failure? 3 - Do you like to sell? 4 - How risk aggressive are you?

_Signing the front of the check_ he explains is a counter intuitive and slightly pathological endeavor.

> You will need to pay the company for the right to work your ass off until you can raise money.

He emphasizes selling as a defining feature of an entrepreneur (much like Peter Thiel does in _Zero to One_). While acknowledging the grimy connotation of sells, he stresses it's necessity.  

> The word "entrepreneur" is a synonym for "salesperson".

> You'd better be damn good at selling if you plan to start a business. Selling is calling people who don't want to hear from you, pretending to like them, getting treated poorly, and then calling them again.

> There has to be a product that doesn't require you to get out the spoon and publicly eat shit over and over. Actually, no, there isn't.

> Entrepreneurship is a sales job with negative commissions until you raise capital, are profitable, or go out of business -- whichever comes first.

> The good news: If you like to sell and are good at it, you'll always make more money, relative to how hard you work, than any of your colleagues, and ... they'll hate you for it.

Ideas, in my own words, to take to heart: What makes successful entrepreneurs interesting is the wide range of skills / personalities traits they have. Necessaries are a tolerance for both risk and humiliation and a willingness for both eating shit now for theoretical gains at a later date and to get down on your knees and sell. Sounds like fun.
