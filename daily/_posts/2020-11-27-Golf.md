One of the many great things about playing golf is the lack of drama. You hit the links with an old friend and all the performing stops. Jokes, needles, memories, plans, and stories mixed with slices, "get up", and "nice shots" are all shared without a hint of second-guessing or watching your tongue and are a wonderful respite from the theater of life. 

I did not know that I was performing so much (even in front of those who I love most).

Golf now fits into the category my friend Jonny calls _Things That Are More Therapeutic Than Therapy_. And I can't wait to get back out there.
