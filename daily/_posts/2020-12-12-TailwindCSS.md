TailwindCSS is a method for styling websites. While you don't see the headline "Sign Up. We will limit your options!" very often, that is part of the promise and excitement of Tailwind.  

"Limited", in this case, is also is implying "standardized". And standardized means fewer errors, less decision fatigue, and fewer repeated key-strokes. 

And limited here does not mean that you can only make sites black/white or only red or blue. The limited choices still allow for [almost endless flexibility.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#default-color-palette)

The promise of limitedness is that it stops you from having to choose between 14px font and 15px font and 16px font and 17px font... With tailwind, you have options like small, medium, large. 

I am looking forward to trying out this new styling philosophy on my next project.
