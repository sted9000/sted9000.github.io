Something helpful, yet troubling in my relationship is what I call Family Dinner Therapy. I first noticed it happening with other relationships and only more recently noticed it happening with my own. FDT is when a couple uses a family environment to facilitate conversations that were proving difficult or stuck in a one-on-one environment. Something about the group setting allows for a more productive conversation. I have my theories as to the mechanisms of why FDT works, but in the end, dinner therapy, like talk therapy, is a way to clarify your thoughts and understand others. This is great.

It is troubling to realize that you are using the all too rare time your family spends eating pizza together to properly communicate with your partner. On the other hand, it highlights yet another wonderful aspect of family. They help with that which you can't do alone.
