A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles is a lovely and timely book (he is under house arrest for life). I regret having finished it, but know that I will carry the main character around in my psyche for a long time to come. He sees the world gracefully and humanely all-the-while having a damn good time. He taught me how accepting your circumstances has no real connection with passivity and cynicism.

9/10 - A great novel for vacation or bed-time reading. 

Recommended by my mom and Micheal Lewis.
