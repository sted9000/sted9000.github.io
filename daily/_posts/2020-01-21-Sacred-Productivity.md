A book about personal management and productivity made the claim that a system of the most profane things you can think of - notepads, checklists, folders, weekly reviews - can result in an almost sacred philosophy.
I have moved from skeptical to curious to optimistic about this idea.
Now, time to try it out and find out.

Vamos a ver.
