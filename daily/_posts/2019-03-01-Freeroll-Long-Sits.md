title: "Freeroll - Long Meditation Sits"
---
25 Sits of one hour or longer before the WSOP starts (What counts as an hour long sit is pretty straightforward: I just have to not get up and leave the room for an hour. I can open my eyes, fidget, give up, and start again all as long as I don't get up and leave).

My intention is to enjoy the practice and enjoy how it positively impacts my mind (which is a complete mess at the moment) and hopefully someday those around me.

This is one of the few areas of life at the moment that is fuelled by curiosity and mystery. That said it will be a struggle at times (hence the freeroll), but I am very much looking forward it both the practice and where it might lead.

Gl us.
