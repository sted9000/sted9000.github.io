My favorite political analyst and a thoughtful random woman both recently emphasized the joys of a predictable and stable government and the detriments of an unpredictable one.

Here in Argentina, for as long as people can remember governments have been unpredictable and unstable. Just recently the newly elected administration imposed a flat 30% sales-tax on goods charged in dollars. The prior administration unpegged the local currency from artificial (and ridiculous) rates and the country saw a 400% devaluation and corresponding inflation over four years. In the 80's the military took charge of the government and many thousands of political opponents _went missing_. When taking these few examples (of many) onboard you can start to see the benefit of boring, stable, slow-moving government.

We as Americans have been so very fortunate over many generations in this regard. The cost however is that we now take predictability and stability for granted when in fact they are not guaranteed.
