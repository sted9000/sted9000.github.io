> The mere name of philosophy, however quietly pursued, is an object of sufficient scorn; and what would happen if we should begin to separate ourselves from the customs of our fellow-men? Inwardly, we ought to be different in all respects, but our exterior should conform to society.

Part of what makes hipsters absurd is that their outward appearance (non-conformist) reveals not a pursuit of philosophy, but shallowness and look-at-me. The woman in the corner with only one ear piercing or the man without a wild yet well-oiled beard is who I would like to talk to about life.
