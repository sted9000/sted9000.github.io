A framing that I have been looking at things through recently is that of trade-offs (i.e. everything has an opportunity cost and nothing is good or bad before you compare it to the alternatives). While this framing takes a bit of the luster away from life at times, I think on the whole it is very healthy, and in the end, very freeing. It is not a plunge into relativism, but rather a humble acknowledgment towards the complexity of the world and the limitations of minds.

Small example: I have been on the cold-shower grind over the past few weeks, but today I really didn't feel like it and took a warm one instead. I realized (while in the shower ironically) that for all the benefits of cold-showers they don't permit the creative mind wandering that showers are famous for.
