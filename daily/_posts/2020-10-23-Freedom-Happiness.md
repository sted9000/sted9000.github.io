The idea that financial freedom and happiness are separate projects seems worth spending a little time thinking through. 

1. Financial freedom does not guarantee happiness.
2. The two projects often get lumped together lazily.
3. You want both.
4. It isn't clear if one is superior to the other.
5. They seem like they could interact in feedback loops - both positively and negatively.
6. A large amount of one and none of the other seems worse than a modest amount of each.
7. Most prioritize freedom at the expense of happiness in early adulthood.
8. It seems sad to see the elderly who lack one or the other.
9. Financial freedom is more 'here is the playbook,' whereas happiness is more of 'figure it out on your own.'
10. Both seem like wonderful choices as gifts in amounts small or large.
