Satisfied and content are, while not as sexy as thrilled and amazed, among the best of emotions and are what makes life so wonderful. I think that the stoic tsunami washing over my media feeds obscures the fact that emotions, while transient and subjective, matter. As Dan Gilbert put it in _Stumbling on Happiness_, emotions don't simply matter, they are what it means to matter.

We can be satisfied when we know we gave something its due and "our all" given its relative importance, even if it doesn't work out in the end. We can feel contentment knowing that everyone is always doing exactly the best they can.
