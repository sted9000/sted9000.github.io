Living in the most consequential state for the 2020 election brings me an unusual amount of joy. Dropping my ballot into the collection box was a highlight of my year. And I am on the edge of my seat to see how the election culminates. 

That said, I wish we had better options. The choice between a high-velocity lying sociopath and a way-past-his-prime career politician who is buying into the moment of wokeness is an easy one, but a disheartening one. Our country is going to face some tough times and a competent leader seems like a necessary condition to navigate those times.

Summary: How wonderful it is to vote and live in the united states. How sad is it that we keep nominating horrible choices to steer the ship?
