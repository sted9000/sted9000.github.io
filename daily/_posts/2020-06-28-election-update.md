This is the last election post for a while... I promise.

My Biden Inc stock has soared 33% in the month since it's purchase. I would like to cash out, take my profits for thinking clearly (a rarity for me), and be on my merry way... however, that is not exactly how this 'system' operates.

You can't offload your bets as if they were shares of stock. Firstly, because the vig/juice/commission is quite high. Secondly, because selling is not actually selling. You need to 'hedge' or 'buy short' by placing bets on the opposing side. This requires tying up and moving around more capital for the next five months.

All this is to say, that unless something takes place that gives me an indication that the price is way off (again), I will see you in November.

P.S. - As I said this was going to be my last election post, keep an eye out for our Democratic VP pick - Susan Rice - we got 50 on her at 20/1.
