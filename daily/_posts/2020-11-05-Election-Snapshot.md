Snapshot of the race at Noon on Thursday.

States still outstanding (Biden's rough chances):
- PA (75)
- GA (50)
- AZ (50)
- NV (50)

Biden's paths include winning PA or any combination of two of the remaining three. 
Because each race is 50/50, Biden wins half of the outcomes (two or three) half the time.
So 0.75 + (1 - 0.75) * 0.5 = 87.5%

If you think that Biden's chances in PA are 50% rather than 75%, you would revise down to 0.5 + (1 - 0.5) * 0.5 = 75%
