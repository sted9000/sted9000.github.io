My friend Vos passed along an idea from a productive writer. The idea is that when you sit down in your studio to write, you are only given the menu of two items: write or do nothing. You have the option of ordering 'do nothing', it is on the menu after all, and therefore you can't feel guilty for ordering it. The theory rests on the assumption that you will promptly find 'do nothing' too bland, summon the waiter,  and change your order to 'write'. Do nothing or write.

I (currently) don't have the luxury of a writing studio, so I will try to modify this idea to my environment. Each location and time pair will have a menu of two items - a productive one and 'do nothing'. At my desk between 10am-12pm I can either program or twiddle my thumbs. Between 6pm-9pm I can play poker or daydream.

This idea is strange because it severely limits your options and at the same time permits your to do anything that can honestly be called 'doing nothing'.
