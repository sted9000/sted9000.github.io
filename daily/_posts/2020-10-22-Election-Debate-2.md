Pre-debate thoughts:
- Biden just needs to be coherent and not play Trumps game of reality TV. No headlines tomorrow is good news for him.
- Trump really needs to through a hail-mary. So watch out Biden.
- While I don't expect to learn anything (a sad attitude), I will be watching each closely to see how they comport themselves and do under the lights.

Post-debate thoughts:
- Both candidates looked much much better stylistically.
- Trump was much more composed, especially in the first half and that could do him some good.
- No bombshells, which was the main objective for Biden. 
- Even draw on corruption talk.
- Biden seemed more empathetic.
- Biden seemed more political (en the negative sense).

All in all, three bags of popcorn and a good outcome for Biden and the Dems.
