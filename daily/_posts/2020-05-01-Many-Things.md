The blog is becoming many things. A random sampling of my life of sorts, not pigeonholed by style or categories. This is not what I had in mind when starting it a few months ago. But let's roll with it for now.

Could Be Styles or Categories:
1. Traditional Blog (put a point on an idea and drop it)
2. Experiment Log (freerolls, diets, routines)
3. Re-posts of inspiration
4. Fiction?
5. Lists
6. Reviews
7. A running brag about how Jonny [lost and will lose again](https://jonnyspicer.com/mendokusai/2020/02/11/i-also-won-and-i-will-also-win-again)
8. A time-capsule (ideas, people, and experience I don't want to be lost)
