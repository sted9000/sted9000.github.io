A quote from one of my favorite books:

> This, then, is the human problem: there is a price to be paid for every increase in consciousness. We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain. - Alan Watts

Perhaps the reason that I like it is because it points out the connection between two supposed independent opposites. In this case the connection is sensitivity.

That said, I struggle with the word and idea of sensitivity. It seems very negative.

[Definitions of sensitivity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sensitivity)
1. the capacity of an organism or sense organ to respond to stimulation : IRRITABILITY
1. the quality or state of being hypersensitive
1. the degree to which a radio receiving set responds to incoming waves
1. the capacity of being easily hurt
1. awareness of the needs and emotions of others

I like definition three for my quote. It is not positive or negative, simply the right state to respond to whatever comes.

An insensitive radio is just a black lump of plastic.
