title: Productivity - Progressive Summarization

My friend is down in the digital note-taking rabbit hole. And his enthusiasm has spread...

A lot of times, after reading, you feel like taking notes. But why? And to what end? Enter Tiago Forte stage left - the creator of the PARA method and productivity cult-hero. 

Progressive summarization is the idea that notes are the container of organization, that they evolve, and that they are taken with your future-self in mind.  Mr. Forte says you should come back to your notes when you need them and opportunistically compress them - move away from the specific context and make them more discoverable - so that your future self will find them useful. If by chance your future self wants to re-discover the context, it will be waiting for you as well. 

I can see how this seems nerdy and useless, but it feels powerful and practical to me.
