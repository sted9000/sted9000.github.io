title: Programming - IDE Feedback

One of the distinctions I am finding between poker and programming is the tools for instant quick feedback. You don't know if your speculative 4bet was correct until you ask your coach or run a simulation (and 99% of the time neither happen). Writing code in an editor such as JetBrains you have instant feedback on style, usage, imports, spelling, and documentation. It is a pleasure to know when you make a mistake so you can correct it, learn from it, and reduce the frequency in which you make it in the future. 

Rather than bitch and moan about the lack of feedback in poker. I plan to do something about it: write some code.
