Living in a city brings about many absurd situations that I would argue are essential to a good life.

The other day on our morning walk Frank and I encountered two middle-aged female walkers or joggers huddled in a little nook. They looked wide awake for it being 7am - and for good reason. They happened upon a chicken wandering down the middle of the street, coaxed it into the nook, and were just beginning to ponder "what the fuck do we do now?".

As Frank and I passed, one of the women approached me and asked if I knew who's chicken it was - as if it were a totally normal question.

...

Today on the same route, we saw a homemade sign. "BIRD" found. Call ###-####.
