I love me some Jordan Peterson.
His [latest book](https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1546721815&sr=8-1&keywords=jordan+peterson+12+rules+for+life) was my favorite book of 2018, I have watched 10's of hours of his youtube content, and I even attended two public events where he spoke last year.
To me, his ideas both ring true and hold up to unimpassioned reasoning.

That said, something has always made me very uneasy about him.
Trying to describe the feeling to a friend, the best I could come up with was
"He is very 'preacherly'.
It's not that I disagree with many of his ideas or his intentions, but his delivery... it just makes me uneasy."
I recognize that my uneasiness is not a solid reason for distrust, but yesterday I believe I stumbled upon the reason for this uneasy feeling.
And it is causing me pause.

[Chris Anderson](https://www.ted.com/speakers/chris_anderson_ted) gave a wonderful interview on [The Ezra Klein Show](https://www.ted.com/speakers/chris_anderson_ted) where he said something along the lines of: People gravitate towards others who feel like they do, but can express themselves in a more provocative way.
That's it.
He is too provocative, unnecessarily.
This sounds like an petty rebuke, but it might have big consequences.
