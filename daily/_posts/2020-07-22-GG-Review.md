I switched to playing Rush and Cash games on GG Poker a month ago. The games looked good and they had Daily Leaderboard promoting the WSOP. Below is a brief review.

## Software

Intuitive to use. Fast to get to your games. Customizable colors and betting options. Not many distracting pop-ups or ads. The one major concern is the crashing of the client. I do not have a super high-powered laptop and the site crashed more than a few times throughout the month.

_Score: 6/10 (fix the crashes and it would be an 8 or 9)._

## Competition

One of the draws of GG was the proportion of recreational players to professionals. I found the games (100 and 200 PLO) to be about 10:90 respectively. Not great. However, the quality of the professional varied widely. Some regulars seemed very solid, thoughtful, and skilled, while others seemed to constantly off their meds. Overall, the competition seemed reasonable, not a juicy t-bone steak, nor a dry un-flavorful jerky, but somewhere in the middle

_Score: 8/10 (if I were a more skilled player I think the competition would be 'crushable')._

## Rake (gross rake, rakeback, and bonuses)

### Gross Rake

5% with 3bb cap. High relative to other sites and high absolutely (between 10-15bb/100).

### Rakeback

It gets complicated here because the rakeback/loyalty system is both hidden and variable. You earn points while playing (ie paying rake), but you do not know how many points you earn per $ in rake. It varies based upon your player profile. All we know is that winning players have a much lower rate than losing players. I am earning around 33 points per $ raked, whereas other claims to be winning anywhere from 10 to 200. Once you earn a certain number of points you get a spin on a wheel to determine your bonus. The probability of the wheel spins is provided from the site and an expected value is easily obtained. As you move up the bonus scale the expected value of the spins moves up (starting at 15% and going all the way up to 50% of the maximum possible amount). Over the month my rakeback was 15%.

### Bonuses

The Daily Leaderboard bonus is interesting because it is not a determined or fixed bonus. Variance, a players strategy, and schedule all contribute to how much the bonus is worth. Without getting into the details, the bonus as been great giving me approximately $6000 in expected value over 70,000 hands (or around 8bb/100).

_Score: 5/10. While the bonus have been great this month, without them the rake is high and rakeback is low. If this month had no bonuses I would be a losing player._

## Numbers and Graphs

### PokerCraft (they only give you pre-rake results)

### My Graphs

*Gross (Pink), Net/Real (Blue), Gross - Rake (Orange), Gross - Rake + Rakeback (Green)*

### Hypothetical if Rakeback was 45% (rather than 15%)

This is the Rakeback Percentage that someone would believe they had by only looking at the sites loyalty scheme as published on their site.

## Overall Score: 6/10

I don't think I will be playing here in the future without a change to the rake structure, but these games could be sustainable to players with a bigger skill-edge than mine. The site is a good addition to the industry as it is a viable competitor to other major sites and could attract more people to the game.

###### Notes

- The rake model is rake contributed. However I think the model used by GG is different. I will update this when I learn more.

- I would like to know my hourly rate. I will update when available.

- All opinions, methods, and data are my own and have not been thoroughly reviewed. I created my own hand history parser to analyze the data.

- There is a discrepancy between my graph and PokerCrafts graph (they think I have won 2.5k more) that I have yet to figure out.
