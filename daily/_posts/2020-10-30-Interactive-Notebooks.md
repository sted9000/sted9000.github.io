While [my first interactive notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sted9000/notebooks/main?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FKelly.ipynb) is extremely basic, the power to create a standalone web-app in seconds is so cool that I needed to share it. I wrote only nine lines of code and have an app that you can see on the other side of the world. Craziness.

Here is how you do it: 
0. Write your code in a Jupyter Notebook
1. Push your code to a repository
1. Go to [Binder](mybinder.org)
2. Point Binder to your repository
3. Tell it to use Voila (which turns Jupyter Notebooks into interactive pages)
4. Click launch

So much is being done for you behind the scenes, but bottom line is that you can share a prototype of models in seconds. I see myself using this lovely piece of free software a lot.
