Two pillars of the project of enlightenment have little push-back: less self referential thinking and more selfless actions. However a third pillar is much more objectionable: a lack of personality.

Apparently buddhist text do not expand on the buddha's personality because the view is that having one is an obstacle on the path to enlightenment.

Imagine not having any personality. It is impossible, but even trying is very off-putting. Dull and bland are the words that come to mind and my teeth clench involuntarily.

That said the few people I've met that have wandered far down this path have not been dull nor bland in the least.

I suspect while joy, tranquility, and compassion are not personality traits, they may make great substitutes.
