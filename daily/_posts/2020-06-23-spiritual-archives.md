Below is a document I found when tidying up my notebook. I think it from 2018, which seems like decades ago.

After reading four books on the spiritual side of life I want to think.

My girlfriend and I recently agreed that often we fail to discern meaningful ideas from those that merely sound or feel good but lack meaning... In this essay I want to explicitly state the meaning I think I found. Maybe a good way to do this is to pull out the most basic statements that all the four authors would agree to without qualification or nuance needed, validate why each would agree, and simply illustrate their thoughts.


1. Things can be better or worse:

    The claim here is simple (and maybe not even worth mentioning). The author of Waking Up – Sam Harris – puts it better than I can:

    > “Now, here’s the one bit of philosophy I’m going to anchor this too: imagine a universe in which every conscious creature suffers as much as it can for as long as it can — I call this the worst possible misery for everyone. The worst possible misery for everyone is bad. If the word bad is to mean anything, surely it applies to the worst possible misery for everyone... the moment you grant me that the worst possible misery for everyone is bad and therefore worth avoiding... well then you have every other possible constellation of conscious experience which, by definition, is better.”

    This claim is not about concepts like Nietzsche’s ideas of pleasure and displeasure being tied together, nor about mindfulness vs ordinary thinking, nor about being one with the universe. It is simply that there is better and worse. All four authors I think would agree on this much.

2. The greatest determinant of our lives is our minds:

    This one stuck out to me because it feels overlooked in my own experience. Here the thing they are claiming is that our consciousness is a product of our minds and that our consciousness is all that matters. That part after the and, “...that our consciousness is all that matters”, is not as radical as it sounds; it is just saying that if there was nothing that is was like to be you, nothing would matter, at-least to you, and everything that does matter to you is because you are conscious.

    This is such a basic claim that I am having trouble finding quotes or examples to validate it directly. However, it seems to be implied in everything they say and I can’t find any contradictions.

3. Our minds, to some degree, can be altered.

    We all agree that jamming an ax through someones skull will alter their mind, but these four authors also agree that we can alter our minds though less violent means – namely how we use our minds now can alter them. Sam Harris says this very clearly, “There is now little question that how one uses one’s attention, moment to moment, determines what kind of person one becomes. Another way of saying that our minds and lives are largely shaped by how we use them”. Robert Wright expresses this view through his endorsement of the modular theory of the mind and stating that specific modules can be promoted or demoted though reinforcement...

4. Meditation is a good tool to alter our minds:

    They all meditate(d) for more than the experience - for how it altered there minds. They range greatly in the way they express this claim – from scientific to wuwu – but they all agree that the tool of meditation alters the mind. A stronger claim could be made that they would all agree that meditation is the best tool to alter the mind. I won’t go that far, but it is fair to say they all at least hint at it.

5. You can practice meditation avidly while living a ‘normal western life’.

    By normal western life I mean something life ‘having a family, not excessively abstaining from pleasures, and having a capitalistic job’. This is evident that they have all led these ‘normal lives’ apart from Osho. And he clearly states his renunciation of the idea that isolation and extreme introversion is a good, “ There is a danger that you become too attached to this introversion. Meditation is an introversion; it leads to your center. If you lose your elasticity and you become incapable of coming back to the periphery, then it is a withdrawal and a dangerous withdrawal”.

While all these books claim much more individually, together they clearly agree on these simple ideas without ambiguity and without wuwu. Furthermore they clearly point to what to do if you took the claims seriously (or were curious): Things could get better or worse because of the mind and we can alter the mind in a positive direction through meditation without giving up a normal life.
