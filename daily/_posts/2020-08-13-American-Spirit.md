The first thing that comes to everyone's mind when the word America is uttered is some synonym of fucked-up. And I whole-heartedly agree, we are fucked up, lost and confused, with no hope in sight. With that said, America's image and current problems can be divorced from what I will call The American Spirit - a set of traits, aspirations, and characteristics that are the positive and mature side of the fucked-up America that we now cringe at.

Moving back to the states here soon, I am very much looking forward to trying to embody and build some of The American Spirit in my psyche. Grit, a blend of temperance and extremism, making up of new rules, consistency, a lack of patience for bullshit, the great-wide-open, individualism, sticking to one's principles... I am not sure how to articulate this American Spirit I am talking about, but I am hoping it makes a comeback in a big way.
