3 of my close friends have started blogging more or less as a direct result of me starting to blog. (Perhaps a bit of consider and arm twisting was also involved.)

I love it. It makes my morning. Every morning.

It is different and a whole lot betting than seeing friends' posts on Instagram.

More hobbyist. More genuine.

So, if you are reading this and are intrigued, please let me know. We can make it happen. You can be the next member of the blogging mafia.
