title: Health - Extra Time

A couple of crazies and I are starting an extended fast today. The first thing I am re-realizing is the extra time that I now possess. Three meals a day doesn't sound like a time suck, but I assure you it is. What goes into a meal?

- thinking about what to buy
- going to the store
- unpacking the groceries
- deciding who is going to cook
deciding what you are going to cook
- cooking
- setting the table
- eating
- clearing the table
- doing the dishes
- putting the dishes away
- cleaning the kitchen
- taking out the trash
- pooping

Extra time feels like a blessing, an appropriate reward for the struggle of an extended fast.
