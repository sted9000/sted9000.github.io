title: "Mental Clarity"
---

A favorite aphorism of mine is:

> "Mental clarity is the child of courage, not the other way around." - NN Taleb

My guess to why I find it so appealing...

First, a thought/feeling I have often is "if only I had mental clarity / sharpness / focus / determination, I could do this or that great thing (i.e. be more courageous).

Two, it fights a common doubt of determinism and it's sharp conclusion of no free-will: _I don't have mental clarity and don't have control of how courageous I am, what am I to do..._

To me this aphorism emphasizes that whether you ultimately have the choice to be courageous or not doesn't really matter. Simply knowing cause (courage) leads to effect (mental clarity) is enough.
