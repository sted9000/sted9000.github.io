We received some good news today. Mica's emergency visa appointment request was accepted and we are (knock on wood) in all likelihood moving back to the United States in less than three weeks. This process has been illuminating. One, it pointed out how many large outcomes in life have a very large element of luck baked in. Two, it showed me how we all deal with uncertainty in our different ways. Three, it has reaffirmed how unbelievably kind each of our families are.
