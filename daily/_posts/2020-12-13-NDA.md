I signed my first (and hopefully last) Non-Disclosure-Agreement (NDA) today. In a year overflowing with ridiculousness, this may take the cake.

- Ideas are not worth much. Execution is.
- My future brother-in-law asked me to sign it.
- I am a silly person. It is like asking the homeless guy babbling to himself in front of the liquor store to sign an NDA. 
- My girlfriend got mad at me for signing it. I have no moral consistency apparently.

I very much like and respect my future brother-in-law and I love and adore my girlfriend, but they are both need to relax.
