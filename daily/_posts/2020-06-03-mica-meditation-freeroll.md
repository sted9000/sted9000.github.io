title: Couples Meditation Freeroll
tags: freeroll

A [new freeroll](https://freerollio.github.io/#0xe1e21512f52f847fc3c5f2838e755ad66bd3043c4fca6ea2c3458f80d5167214)!

I just won a freeroll from a friend and wanted to give one back. This is going to be my first 'couples-freeroll' where I am relying not only upon myself, but on us both. It is a test to the effectiveness of freerolls to non-gamblers and a test on this couples cooperation skills. Good luck us.

Details:
- For the remainder of June we must each sit to meditate for thirty minutes.
- We are allowed to each miss two days.
