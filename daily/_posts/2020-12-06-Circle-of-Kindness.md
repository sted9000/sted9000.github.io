title: Idea - Circle of Kindness

I am often conflicted about _the circle of kindness_. How far should one extend kindness? From one's self, to his immediate family, extended family, friends, acquaintances, community, nation, world (all humans), all beings. This is a timeless question and one that I imagine most people grapple with to some degree during their lives. Today I heard a beautiful answer:

On an individual level, we all have opinions on how far the circle of kindness should extend (which can and should be debated). But from a civilization's point of view, there is no one answer. This is because the environment changes and we need the skills to adapt to it. We need the self-interested, the family-man, the community service member, the government politician, and the non-borders-lefty-utopians because each has a unique set of skills.
