Today has been a day filled with a special type of joy. Today we furnished our apartment and are thrilled with the outcome. The joy is not simply the excitement of new toys and aesthetic spaces, I think the joy is coming from the fact that we put in work ahead of time to get good deals, we put in a hard day's work running around getting everything, we received help from a stranger, and we got lucky. Top that off with a good outcome, and we are left with a joy that I hope fills our home for the year(s) to come. A joy that is more story than substance and more memory than style.
