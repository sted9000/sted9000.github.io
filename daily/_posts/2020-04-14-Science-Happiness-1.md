Have I mentioned **A great podcast** - [The Science of Happiness](https://samharris.org/podcasts/196-science-happiness/).

A cool tool brought to you by the coolest of all tools - our minds. And it involves time travel!

You can positively impact the disposition of your future self by imagining your way in the future self will reflect on an event. Confused? Here is an example:

Before an interview you are nervous. Tool: Think about how your future self will reflect on the interview. "Tough questions, I like answering tough questions, they make me think". Then during the interview when you get asked a tough question you can not panic and have a moment of relaxation or joy because your frame for this situation has been positively imagined.

That is cool. I can use to help put in the hours at work. Imagine my future self being proud and satisfied at the end of a long day's work :)
