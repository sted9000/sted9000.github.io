Well, it is 11:30 pm and I have yet to write a blog for today...

Mica and I are both excited about moving to the States. She is excited to see what grad-school will be like and to have amazon at her fingertips. I am excited to see friends and family, to speak English again, and eat cheesesteaks until I drop.

When we first started dating, by definition, there were many firsts and clear divisions in time and space that we playfully called 'new chapters' in our relationship. Over the last few years of being living in the same place, we have lost the framing of the chapter. I suppose is both good and bad. Good because we had consistency and were able to accomplish a great deal because of it. Bad because an adventurous aspect was missing.

It is nice to feel adventure in the pages ahead once again.
