A great podcast - [The Science of Happiness](https://samharris.org/podcasts/196-science-happiness/).

Happiness is a loaded word partially because it's comprised of more than one first-person perspective:

1. Are you happy _in your life_. Moment-to-moment.
2. Are you happy _with your life_. Where you are, who you are.

The distinction is useful because even though most of the time we are _in our lives_, we have times of reflection where being happy _about your life_ seems important as well.

On a personal note I could be doing better on both fronts.

1. Daily I spend time lost in frustration due to a lack of perspective combined with avoidable agitation.
2. "If only X happened, I would be..." is too frequently a guest in my mind to honestly say that I am happy _about my life_.

To be continued...
