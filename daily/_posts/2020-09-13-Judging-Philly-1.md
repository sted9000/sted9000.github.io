Over the past ten years my 'judging mind' has been quieted to a large extent - less is good or bad, right or wrong, heavenly or evil. With that said, this series will indulge this part of my mind.

Good - Parks. A break from the building, roads, and cars. Especially early morning.

Bad - Aggressive Honking. This is one of the few things that drives me crazy. I fantasize about pulling people from their cars, putting them in head-lock, and spitting loud noises down there ear canals. "Does this ring a bell? What a great idea this is? Loud noises are a big help to the problem arn't they? You piece of shit."

While I have no remedy for the honking (short of my seeking professional mental health help), I do plan on spending as much time as I can in Clark Park in the early mornings while the weather is nice.
