A new [freeroll](https://freerollio.github.io) has been issued.

One of the coolest things about freerolls is they help you consistently be your _best self_ by incentivizing you to heed your own advice.

This particular freeroll has the purpose of giving a boring trial enough time to see if any meaningful results come of it. I simply need to post one [Hand of the Day](https://slvrsluger.com/hand-of-the-day) on my poker blog for a month-long stretch.

Results will be found back here at the beginning of May. Good Luck us.
