If you believe the models (I do) and you believe in John Kelly's Scientific Gambling Method (I do), then a decent portion of your day today will be figuring out how to move money around and bet more on Biden. 

Kelly's Formula says: take the probability of winning * (payoff + 1)  - 1 all over the payoff.

Or: (p * (b + 1) - 1) / b

In our case: Biden stands at 87% and the payoff is 0.5. Do the math if you want to ruin your day :)
