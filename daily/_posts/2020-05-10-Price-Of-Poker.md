Price of Poker - An idea a friend had and that I have been thinking about. Every professional poker player (and perhaps many amateurs) has created a spreadsheet titled Rake Structures to help inform them what site and stakes they should play on.

Here are my initial thoughts:

1. Some sites like this already exist, but all have problems.
   1. [rakeatpoker.com](https://rakeatpoker.com/) - Outdated, good info and charts
   1. [yourpokerdream.com](https://www.yourpokerdream.com/the-big-rake-comparison-of-all-online-poker-sites-2018/) - Not stake specific
   1. [rakerace.com](http://www.rakerace.com/poker_rooms) - Good filters, but not focused on rake
   1. [rakeback.com](http://www.rakeback.com/rakeback-calculator/) - Only has a small list of sites, but nice that it tells you a specific number for rake/rakeback.
1. It would be really easy to make if all the data you use is static.
1. SEO would be very important.
1. It has fixed costs approaching zero.
1. Make it simple. Do only one thing (how much rake you pay and how much you will save by switching to a better site).
1. It is important to let the users know the last update of the information. Most of the current sites are outdated and give bad advice.
1. Make it interactive so that the user can say "I will make an extra $165 a month if I click sign up for this new site.
1. Easy exit strategy (get traffic -> sell to big affiliate site)
