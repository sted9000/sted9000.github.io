Another barometer: Do you shovel your neighbors driveway? 

- If yes, you are not sleep deprived.
- If yes, you are not in a hurry.
- If yes, you are not extremely self-interested.
- If yes, you care about your community.
- If no, you are tired.
- If no, you are rushed.
- If no, you are too concerned with yourself.
- If no, you want to go it alone.
