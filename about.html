<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    Personal about sections have always struck me as strange. It seems that what you write can have give off so many signals - blunt, subtle, explicit, implicit, conscious, unconscious - as to be nearly impossible to decipher. If Freud was around today, I could well imagine that he would be running the latest machine learning algorithms on about-pages and detecting that the number of paragraphs strongly correlates to deep truths about lust for your mother... I digress...
</p>
<p>
    My idea is that this specific about page becomes a living document - changing periodically to reflect the times and my estimation of my place in it. Given that I don't have any need or desire to market myself at the moment, I will stick to the boring facts of how I spend my time and where my attention tends to wander.

    I have developed a daily blogging habit that consumes part of my time and attention each day. More generally, writing has helped me get some semblance of control over my mind by allowing me to unload some things, identify how I feel about others, and expand or clarify yet others.

    I spend a few hours a day playing, thinking about, or studying poker. These few hours have paid for the many bills, meals, and adventures over the past fifteen years and I have no plan to stop gambling for a living anytime soon. I have learned innumerable skills from this profession. Top among them are process-oriented thinking (rather than results-oriented) and understanding emotion's roll in decision making. Some weeks I love my job. Other weeks I find it boring and almost unbearable.

    A few years ago I started learning the basics of computer programming and today I find myself writing code almost daily. Having developed a few scripts to aid my poker studies and a few diverse websites, my idea is that my resume will be written in code when or if I am ever ready for a career change.

    I have been on a Buddhism kick for a while now and spend a few minutes crosslegged each day. Between my intermittent daily practice and having attended a few extended meditation retreats, I have been left with a basic understanding of my own mind, how amazingly strange the basic fact of consciousness is, and how a lot of my personal suffering is completely optional. I find it hard to imagine that I will cease this spiritual adventure of mental health, psychology, and wellbeing anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
    That's pretty much it how I spend my time and attention. And of course, I do the normal and wonderful little things that everyone else does as well. I get taken on two joyous walks by my dog Frank (the coolest dog in the world), I try to return the love that my beautiful partner Mica showers upon me, I enjoy laughing, planning, chatting to a few great friends, and I take great joy in being the son of kind parents and the sibling of two thoughtful and brave brothers and a lovely and stubborn sister.
