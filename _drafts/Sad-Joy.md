Upon reflection, I am sad that I was overjoyed upon hearing about our president's contraction of coronavirus. It says a lot about him, but surely something about me as well. What I think it says is that I don't have enough true compassion. I have compassion only when it is easy or convenient.

I think the program for building for true compassion - if there is one - might be to read broadly, live fully, and spend some time alone with your mind.

So, even though I doubt that our president has done much to build compassion in himself, I wish him a full and speedy recovery.
