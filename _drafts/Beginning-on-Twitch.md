I am going to start streaming my poker play on Twitch here soon. This post will serve as a journal entry of my thoughts before commencing this experiment.  

- It feels wrong because "everyone is doing it."
- Having even one viewer will help me play more consistently.
- I expect that vocalizing my thoughts will be very cognitively demanding at first and then become rather second nature after a few weeks.
- I hope that it will help me build good habits of thinking.
- The thinking is to do it until the end of the year and then re-evaluate. Two and a half months seems like the right amount of time to gauge the pros and cons.
