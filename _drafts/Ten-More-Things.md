With many changes in scenery, people, and routines coming up with our move to Philly, here are ten more things I am very much looking forward to:

1. Going to Japan someday
2. Using my brother's fiancee's pottery
3. Watching my father fall in love with Frank
4. Watching a baseball game for the first time in years
5. A New York pizza
6. Physical books on demand
7. Super Markets and more consumer choices
8. Watching my mom fall in love with Frank, but never admitting it
9. The unknown that will surely come with moving
10. Laughing more often (because I am more comfortable with English than Spanish)
