I feel a little grimy. Today I wrote and "schedule sent" a Happy Birthday email to my Aunt. This is the slippery slope to hell paved with good intentions (I think I am combining metaphors here). First, you don't physically go to see your Aunt on her birthday (modern independent man is far too busy for that). Second, you write her an email rather than call her (because god forbid you inconvenience someone with a phone call). Now, you write the email and "schedule send" it a week early because it was on your to-do list with HIGH PRIORITY.

Technology is great. Humans and the culture we build for ourselves sometimes suck.
