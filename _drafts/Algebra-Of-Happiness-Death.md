[The Algebra of Happiness](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/21/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Intro) discusses death a fair bit. The author's has two notes on death. Firstly...

> If you're in a position -- and many aren't -- to make a loved one's exit more graceful, do it -- you'll cherish the experience for the rest of your life.

This is something I have been thinking more about. Parents and grandparents are now much closer to the exit than the entrance. His recount of taking care of his dying mother, though admittedly imperfect, provided a nice model to have in my mind.

His second note on death is that no evidence of an afterlife makes this life more precious, rather than less. Can't mess this one up. Agreed and amen.
