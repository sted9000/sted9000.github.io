In the previous post, I laid out my take on bankroll management. Here I will apply it.

Bankroll-Liferoll Separation:

Step 1 - Know your burn: I have a spreadsheet that has all my monthly expenses (and yearly expenses evenly distributed monthly). My tally is at 		$1495. Add 25% for taxes, and we are at $1850. Rounding up, $2000 / month 'burn'.

Step 2 - Withdrawing your burn periodically: The first of every month I transfer my burn from my online bankroll to my checking account. Two notes here: One, it is often a two or three-step process getting money from an online poker site to a 'legitimate' financial institution. Stick with it from start to finish. Two, it is disheartening to see your online roll whacked every month. If you are playing smaller stakes you could see 10,20, or even 50 buy-in disappear. While sucky, this monthly event keeps you connected to reality and reality is always the way to go.

Risk-of-Ruin:

Step 1 - Know your temperament and relationship to poker: Every personality test I have taken (and had others taken about me) has returned the unequivocal fact that I am extremely risk-averse. As to my relationship to poker. It is certainly not a calling, nor is it a dreary and dreaded job. I supposed that by default places it in the middling category of a career - enough road ahead to make sacrifices now, enough money to be enticing, and rough and rich enough to scratch my itch towards the interesting and novel.

Step 2 - Do the math: The first variable you want to figure out is how much am I making (in terms of bb/100) after factoring in my $2000 per month burn? My win-rate after rakeback is 8bb/100 at 100PLO and I play about 30,000 hands per month. That translates to $2400 winnings a month. Subtract the $2000 and I am left with a meager 1.3 bb/100. Enter this win-rate into a risk-of-ruin calculator along with the standard deviation of your game and you will be shown your bankroll requirement paired to various levels of risk-of-ruin. Since I am not willing to move down in stakes, this is the end of math.

Step 3 - Create a system that incorporates what you have learned from steps one and two: Knowing that I am naturally a very risk-averse person and my desire to grow, earn, and learn in poker I want to find a happy middle ground where I will have enough comfort in knowing my risk-of-ruin is low, yet not low enough to prevent me from facing the challenges and potential increased earning potential of moving up in stakes. I have settled on 2%. Thinking that in 1/10 lives I will go broke is too uncomfortable. Having a one-in-a-million chance of going broke is dreadfully boring. 2% seems like a happy middle. Given this, I know that my bankroll needs to be above 20,000 bbs or 200 buy-ins before moving up in stakes. Simplify a bit and my system becomes:
< 20k means I need to be playing 100PLO
> 20k means playing 200PLO
> 30k means start to think about shots higher than 200PLO

Shot Taking:

Because I am risk-averse I have shied away from taking shots. To overcome this bias I now have a system.
1 - Anytime my bankroll hits 21k, I take a 5 buy-in shot at 200PLO.
2 - Each month, if I have not yet taken a shot, I will do it on the last day of the month for one session (even if my bankroll is under 20k).
This system fits into my risk-of-ruin plan as well as gives me the benefits of consistent shot taking.  I know if I did not have this system in place I would go months or years without moving up in stakes.

That's it. No more bankroll management talk for months and hopefully years to come. See you at the tables.
