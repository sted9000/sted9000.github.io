We are 90% moved in. From Buenos Aires Argentina to Philadelphia Pennsylvania it has been a long journey. What makes it long is not the physical distance or the time, but the volume of decisions required along the way. I estimate many thousands of relatively unique decisions needed to be made. And the increased volume reveals deficiencies in decision making.

Which decisions should be considered carefully and which should be snap decisions? Whose opinions matter when making a decision? When do you have enough information to make the decision? How proactive, assertive, or forceful should you be in the decision process? How much energy do you spend second-guessing decisions?

It has been messy and stressful at times. But we have navigated through the decision minefield relatively gracefully. And while I am looking forward to the last 10% of the move-in to be complete, I don't dread the chance to do it all over again someday and implement a few things I have learned.
