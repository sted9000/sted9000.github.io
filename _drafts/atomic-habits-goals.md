- Forget about goals, focus on systems instead.
	- Winners and losers have the same goals.
	- Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
	- Goals restrict your happiness.
	- Goals are at odds with long-term progress

- A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.
- A goal-oriented mind-set can create a "yo-yo" effect.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
