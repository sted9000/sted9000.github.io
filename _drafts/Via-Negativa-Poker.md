From the Art of Manliness

> Via negativa is a Latin phrase used in Christian theology to explain a way of describing God by focusing on what he is not, rather than what he is; understanding Deity’s positive qualities is a task deemed impossible for the finite minds of humans.
Via negativa can also be used to describe a similarly “negative” way of improving one’s life; instead of concentrating on what you do, the focus turns to what you don’t do...

Thinking about this in poker recently has been useful. Many situations have a large amount of 'mixing'. Effectively this means that different actions have similar expected values. So, what to do?

For a while now, I have been worrying a lot about the details of this mixing. For example, if a situation calls of betting 60 percent of the time and checking the remaining 40 percent, I would ask, what specific 60 percent should I bet?

But there is another way to go about it - via negativa. If the expected values are similar and you remove the ability to view the details of the specific hands, what remains?

The answer is your: opponent, his tendencies, and his psychology.

This is now quite obvious writing it out... Hmm... Whatever... Thinking about this 'obvious' fact in this framework - of taking away information and details to see what remains  - has been very helpful as of late. And I suppose that is what is important.
