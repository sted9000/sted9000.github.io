My intuitions are being thrown about regarding the topic of meritocracy (a system in which advancement is based on individual ability or achievement).

My prior inclinations were in strong support of a merit-based system, both from an ethical and practical standpoint. It is 'in my blood' both in the sense of believing in benefits of the evolutionary principle of survival of the fittest and in the sense of growing up in a culture that idolized the American system of meritocracy.

That said, a few threads have been wound together to call my inclination of the virtue of a meritocracy into question. And then yesterday hearing an evidence-based rail against meritocracy has me turning on my head.

Has meritocracy given us as much as we think it has?

What would replace a merit-based system?

How much is motivation tied to compensation for merit?

These now seem like approachable questions rather than heresy. Time to take a closer look.
