Avoiding doing my taxes, I ran a half marathon yesterday afternoon. From West Philly (a bit hood), to Independence Hall (decadence), through the Homeless Tent City (mental health crisis), up the Rocky Steps (inspiration), down to the riverside trail (beauty), around Rittenhouse Square (wealth), by The Liberty Bell (history), across I95 (engineering), and down to the docks (industry), the changing scenery of the short 13.1 miles took me through the full range of emotions.

I'm curious to see where the full 26.2 miles leads.
