A quick retraction or reversion of thought: I want to stay sane between now and election day. Upon reflection, sanity seems better than rollercoasters (or more accurately "The Egg Scrambler") at the moment. Therefore, I will limit my media intake. No twitter between now and then. Only data such as the polls, models, and betting lines during my morning routine.

To everyone else out there on the Egg Scrambler, I wish you a pleasant ride. I look forward to November 4th when I can look back and see what I did or didn't miss.
