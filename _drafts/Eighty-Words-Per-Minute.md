While practicing my typing, I have noticed a certain 'zone' right on the border between automatic typing and consciously directing your finger to each key. This area of practice feels like it is far superior to either or both done individually. I don't know why this is of course, but it feels right.

Until my progress stalls out, I will stick with trying to find this zone and see where it leads. Today 80wpm :)
