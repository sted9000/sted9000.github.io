Yesterday I felt like an idiot all day - how absurd my desires are, the low quality and incoherence of my thoughts, and how many things I forget was evident all day.

Disheartened by this "mood of idiot" we ate at ShakeShack (because at least I still can stuff my face with the best of them)... I don't know where I was going with this sentence.

Anyway, this morning I still feel like an idiot, but a hopeful one. Hopefully knowing a bit about how my idiocy works can help me hack together a pleasant (and perhaps even a productive) life. And hopeful that knowing that I am an idiot ape can motivate me to be less of one.
