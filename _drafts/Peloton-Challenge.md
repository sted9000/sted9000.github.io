I have a new challenge going and strangely it was not my idea. Mica (my girlfriend) is taking advantage of her large amounts of down-time during the quarantine by focusing and dedicating a lot of effort towards her physical health. She has built a good habit around exercising, now she wants to eat very healthfully and see what happens :)

So for the next 100 days, we are going to be eating under strict guidelines: no sugar, no flour, no dairy, and no artificial sweeteners or preservatives. If we support each other (and our relationship manages to survives 'hanger', many cravings, and the general crankiness of healthy eating) and both stay true to the plan, we are going to splurge on a Peloton Bike when we move to Philly.

Wish us luck.
