Yesterday's mini-adventure was running up the "Rocky Steps" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Surely sprinting up the steps and looking back over the city was the highlight of my morning. Wrong. One of the wonderful things I am coming to find out about living in Philly is that the unexpected should be what you expect.

A few blocks from the museum, in what Google Maps showed as green space, I found myself running through the center of a Tent City. A hundred or so make-shift houses situated on the side of the avenue. It was my first up-close look at a Tent City (they are becoming more and more numerous in major US cities). I don't have any reactions to it other than profound confusion.

After making it up the "Rocky Steps", a James Baldwin quote in the museum's courtyard had me thinking rather than feeling amped up from channeling my inner Balboa.

> Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing can be changed until it is faced.

My morning was not what I had imagined. I was very content.

Until tomorrow, be well.
