As I age, I feel more gratitude towards my parents. While positive, I have been reminded that this sentiment is largely misplaced.

Shared environment (parents) accounts for almost none of the differences we care about between people. This is to say that parenting-style and tactics are not very predictive in determining children's outcomes. All the differences between people can be accounted for by genes (biology) and non-shared environment (friends and peers).

This is counterintuitive, bordering on shocking. It is also a bit liberating (as you don't have to worry as much about being the perfect parent) and, importantly, does not necessarily cancel gratitude.

Thank you Mom and Dad for not letting me have bad friends and for the billions of genes that are largely responsible for who I am.

For what it's worth (not much apparently), you were good parents too.
