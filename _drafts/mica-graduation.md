Not much to say... today was wonderful. My girlfriend graduated from university by delivering her thesis defense via Zoom. I hired a Python coach... That was about all that happened.

No news, gossip, Instagram, work, money, Trump, or race. Just people and smiles.

Like I said, a wonderful day.

Until tomorrow, be well.
