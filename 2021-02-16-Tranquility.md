Tranquility is hard to come by for me these days. Lots of stimulus seems to be the flavor of the week. And it has been the flavor for a few weeks in a row now. 

It is not that I dislike this life full of excitement, ideas, interaction, deadlines, meetings, calls, slack channels, emails, training, and take-out food. I just feel a little out of control. My interactions are a bit shallower. My desires a bit more immediate. My patience and judgment a bit weaker.
