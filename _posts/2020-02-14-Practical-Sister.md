While not learning much of anything mundane or merely practical from my little sister (this is meant to be a veiled compliment), recently I have been writing this blog on the elliptical.

The notion that one could maneuver an elliptical, without hands, while thinking, while typing, surely never would have occurred to me without her graceful example.

Thanks Jayne. When I win this bet, _again_, dinner is on me.
