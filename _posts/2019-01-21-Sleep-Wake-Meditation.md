I clearly remember on retreat thinking of ways to explain what it was like --
how is a mindful approach through life different from the normal distracted life.
The analogy that clicked was that distracted is to mindful as sleeping is to waking.
At the time I could not really explain why that analogy was apt, but now, learning a bit about sleep I think I can explain my reasoning a bit.

The question was posed: How do you, know that you have slept?

The answer was two-fold: Loss of conscious external awareness and time distortion.

This gives me a good ways to try to explain the difference in mindfulness vs ordinary consciousness.

Warning: The Buddha talk is about to come out...

#### Lack of Conscious External Awareness:

Basically, when you are thinking without knowing that you are thinking the external world doesn't exist to you -- your conscious self is in a different world much the same way that your conscious self is in a different world while dreaming.

Trivial example: When your are meditating you always notice when the heat-pump kicks on and shuts off. When you are thinking without knowing that you are thinking you normally do not.

Not so trivial example: When you are meditating you notice how repetitive your patterns of though at. When you are thinking without knowing that you are thinking you normally do not.

Basically the more mindful you are, the more the external world has a chance to appear in your consciousness. Ordinary conscious is too filled with thoughts and stories to be aware of the external world.

#### Time Distortion

Shit just slows down when you are meditation and when you are on retreat.
