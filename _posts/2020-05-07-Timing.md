I think most of the time when people say "It's all in the timing", they are pointing to the fact that good timing is both essential and overlooked.

I agree wholeheartedly.

At the beginning of my poker career I had an inflated view of my competencies and talent. However, the games were soft (timing). This granted me enough time to gain strategic competency, hone my intuition, and build the soft skills needed to become a decent professional. This took years.

Simply put: I do not think I would have survived if the games were tough when I graduated from university in 2012. I had good timing.

Over the years the game became tougher (primarily due to fewer recreational players). If you wanted to start a professional poker career in 2017 you had bad timing.
