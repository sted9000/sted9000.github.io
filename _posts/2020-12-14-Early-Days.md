A small step in my project [gambitplo](https://gambitplo.com) today, but it is the first time I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

It is funny. I know that in a few years I will look back on this project and laugh the same way I do when I stumble upon footage or notes I took at the beginning of my poker journey. Much like those early days of poker were exciting, so are these days filled with tutorials, typos, and confusion (what the hell is a proxy server?).
