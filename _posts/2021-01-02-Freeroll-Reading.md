Freeroll Update: I finished my _read six non-fiction books in 2020_ freeroll. After a lot of self-imposed distraction and procrastination, I read five books in December and loved it. It reminded me why I made the freeroll in the first place: Reading non-fiction allows me to spend time with and engage with very thoughtful people. This was a real treat and one that I hope to continue to enjoy this year. 

Freeroll incoming.
