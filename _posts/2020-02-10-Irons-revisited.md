I suppose some things take priorities over others (obvious upon reflection, not so obvious moment-to-moment).

While I would like to be able to say that I have all my shit figured out and am focusing on creative and selfless things, that is not exactly the case...

Hence, my priorities at the moment are these: sleeping 8-9 hours a night, sitting down to meditate for an hour a day, and putting in hours at the poker tables.

Sleep, sit, sacrifice... Then on to bigger, better, and more beautiful things.
