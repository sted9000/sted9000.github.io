What are the markers of a fit mind?

Physically we have strength, flexibility, endurance, and resilience as generally agreed upon measurable characteristics of fitness. Do these have mental equivalents?

Strength: ability to process a large volume of inputs.

Flexibility: ability to process a wide range of inputs.

Endurance: ability to process inputs over periods of time.

Resilience: ability to recover from processing inputs.

That all seems right and maybe it can serve as a good foundation, but just as physical fitness has little predictive power in a street fight it seems these markers of mental fitness bare little in common to what we care about when we talk about mental well-being.
