A am always amazed at my lack of self-awareness. My ability to not know how I am doing, feeling, or performing is impressive and is the reason that barometers are a great thing.

Today our internet went out for an extended period of time during which I was insane. I literally checked the connection 20 times in a span of 3 hours and I could not sit still for more than 5 minutes.

This was my barometer. It pointed to a lack of 'calmness on demand' - I could not calm myself when the situation called for it. Tomorrow I am going to sit down for 20 minutes of TM Meditation.

What other barometers are in my life that I am oblivious too?
