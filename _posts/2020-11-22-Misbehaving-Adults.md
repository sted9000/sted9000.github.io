My parents are not acting as I would like them to regarding the pandemic. What to do about it is the question. 

Definitely:
- Model good behavior.
- Keep them informed of the facts.

Perhaps:
- Kindly put forth the logical case for better behavior.
- Kindly put forward the emotional case for better behavior.
- Refuse to see them if they don't change their actions. 
- Get angry with them.
- Nag them about their behavior. 
- Decide they are grown adults and have made their bed willingly.

More generally, the theme of when do you forcefully and directly tell a loved one that you believe they are fucking up has been popping up frequently. 

This is a hard one for me to untangle. On the one hand, I have my disposition of very risk-avoidant, a philosophy of do-no-harm, and a skepticism in my own beliefs. On the other, I hold the notion that tough conversations are worth having and can be without the slightest bit of harshness or self-righteousness. 

Normally, I don't mind being contradictory -- a pizza after a fat-loss workout, but this contradiction leaves me with a great deal of unease.
