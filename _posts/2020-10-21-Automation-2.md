Thinking a bit more about automation today, I realized that a lot of what we do falls under its broadest definition. A little thought experiment brought me to realize that much of what I am automating away today would be exactly what I would love to learn and do if I successfully automated away all of life's inconveniences. I would love to grow, hunt, and prepare my own food for example. 

What I think this thought experiment reveals is that we should roothlessly automate most things, but then do the things you love as manually, slowly, and close to the source as possible. This is an application of NN Taleb's barbell principle at work. To-automate-or-not-to-automate also provides a fun and useful lens in which to look at the world.
