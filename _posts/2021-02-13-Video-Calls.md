I have had a lot of online conversations over the last few days. A few take-aways:

- I am always inspired after talking to my friends. They are kind, brave, and happy people. It is infectious.
- Counseling over the internet is 90+% as effective as in-person. 
- The convenience of not having to leave your plan, get dressed, and drive to share a laugh is wonderful.
- One universal video platform would be nice rather than switching between 2 or 3.
- Talking to someone is the best way to clarify your thinking, discover where you are full of shit, and explore new ideas.
- Having a cup of tea is a good reminder and prop for talking less and listening more.
