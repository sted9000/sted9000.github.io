Something that I am starting to feel is true: A healthy and happy relationship is made up of two people who both know and feel they would be healthy and happy alone or apart. 

Without this foundation, real growth feels impossible. 

I am sure there are terms, books, and whole psych departments looking at this issue. And I know nothing about all that. All I know is that I have been more and less happy in my relationship and to the best of my knowledge it was because I was more and less grounded to the feeling that I would be fine if I were alone. And while I don't have the vocabulary to write about this yet, it is a strong and wonderful feeling born out of the blue.
