> I hate design!

This is one of the lies I often tell. The truth is that I very much enjoy adding style to the user-interface of my projects. The trouble is that 1 - It is tedious work thus often distracts from the goal of a functional program, 2 - It is one of those things that you think "creativity" should be enough to guide you, but it is not. 

I don't hate design. It is a skill that I would like to get better at. Add it to the list.
