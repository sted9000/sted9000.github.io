My extended holiday season is coming to an end. It was a strange one for sure. Rather than being strictly jovial and festive, this year was more pensive and recuperative. I will hesitantly say I learned a few things:

1. Being non-judgemental and "proactive caring" can happen at the same time. In fact, they are even conductive to each other.
1. Extended time away from your partner is necesarry and wonderful. It feels natural, healthy, and essential to a deepening relationship.
1. I have a lot of confidence in my view of human nature and what makes those around me do what they do. While unchecked, this confidence manifests as a pompous and high-minded prick. Harnessed wisely it could be a super-power.
1. The quality of 93% of my thoughts are complete shit, 5% are meh, 1% is creative, and 1% is intelegent. The good... the great news is that there is a lot of upside, and not much downside. Almost freerolling on any endevour to enhance creative and intelegent thought.
