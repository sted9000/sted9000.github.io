I have quickly devolved from American Ninja Warrior to _the average american_., as I am about 20% as active as I was before the quarantine started and I can't pinpoint why. Some theories:

1. A lot of my habits were broken both by the quarantine and my rare case of shingles. Perhaps my prior 'commitment' to health and exercise was nothing more than a few good and stable habits.

2. I have finally shed some pathology that had me exercising like the energizer bunny. Now I am left with normality and the struggle to do what is good for me.

3. I have been working lots of long hours. Perhaps this plays into my slothish behavior as of late.

Whatever the cause turns out to be it has at once been frustrating and illuminating to finally understand what people are feeling when they say "I just don't have the time, energy, or motivation to exercise."
