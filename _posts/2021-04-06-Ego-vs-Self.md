Here might be (yet another) tool for helping us think: The mind is The Ego and The Self. The Ego is the logical and judging voice. The Self is the intuitive voice that lives adjacent to meaning, spirituality, and creativity. When you are having trouble doing meaningful work (your calling) it may be because The Ego is afraid of losing the battle to The Self. So The Ego (who is very clever) comes up with all sorts of rational and logical reasons not to do your work. Ojo.
