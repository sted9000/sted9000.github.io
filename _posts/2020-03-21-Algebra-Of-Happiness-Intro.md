I recently finished a _self help_ book of a different sort. Normally I consume flavors of Buddhist philosophy with varying narratives and covers. Thoughts are silly and ultimately uncontrollable. Emotions are fleeting. Material striving is unwise. Attachment is the root of discontent...

The Algebra of Happiness by Scott Galloway is not one of those books, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it is packed with nuggets that I would be wise to reflect on and take to heart. So let's do just that.

Intro / Background: The author is a business school professor and a serial founder. He is sort of an asshole (admittedly and as a side note we need another word for _self-aware assholes_ as they are very very different than unaware ones). He had what I would call an American upbringing - divorced family, normal adolescence interests, and an unremarkable performance at a public university. All in all he seems like someone I can somewhat relate to and would like to sit and have a beer with. And this book is what I would expect him to spit out if I were to buy him a few and pick his brain.
