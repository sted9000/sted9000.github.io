Some predictions about the education space.

- Fall Semester classes at major universities will be 100% online.
- A starker contrast between the _Top Ten_ universities in the world and the rest in the next decade.
- A new major player (a tech giant) in the online education space.
- Lowering of cost at middle of the road universities over the next decade (due to decreased demand).
- A ton of smaller online education options - workshops, mentors, exercise instructors, etc. persisting.
- Enrollment in Coursera classes up triple digit percentages.

Looking forward to seeing how this shakes out. Perhaps someday we will think of COVID-19 as "The Great Accelerator in Education Innovation".
