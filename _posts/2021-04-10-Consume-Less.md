I have started this blog a few times without any luck. So today I will use my monthly get-out-of-jail-free gratitude post. 

- Good customer service. Quick, no bs, make the customer happy within the bounds of reason.
- Laughing at yourself. The world could have been one where we take ourselves even more seriously than we do and where we would never laugh at ourselves.
- Spring after a long winter.
- Marvel Movies.
- Unreasonably good health. 
- Salmon. What a tasty fish.
