I am reading the first volume of Seneca's Letters to Lucilius for the first month of my reading challenge. They are a collection of letters written by a stoic thinker around the year 0! 

Side note: I assume that people living in the year 0 were not giving too much thought that they were living through the beginning of modern time. It is cool to imagine they were.

It always strikes me of the similarity of the nature of our problems. One of the first letters is _On Discursiveness in Reading_ where Seneca warns against consuming too many ideas from too many authors. It will lead to an unsettled and unproductive mind. What would Seneca say if he saw YouTube?
