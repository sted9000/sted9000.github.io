One resolution this year is to continue to explore meditation.
The number one way I want to explore is to sit down on a more regular basis.

Setting a simple goal of sitting everyday seems right.
In the past I have pushed towards loftier goals and ended up dreading sitting.
This seems like one area where pushing and efforting seems sub optimal.
Curiosity and a friendly freeroll seem like a better motivator.

The goal is to string together the rest of January.

Here is the [link](https://freerollio.github.io/#0x6d73f296bbfd34589925acddf0d0e9fcebb0723a327f68d63d5d0c0e43fa0d9f) for the freeroll on freeroll.io.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-NB--uXIAu98iBTQUxaljHtol57G57hT/view?usp=sharing) is my current streak as of 07/01/19.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oYOaF_cQr5EAN_cMPUP2M5gR4lfLNT-4/view?usp=sharing) is where I will post my streak after 31/01/19.

Good luck us.
