A few things that I would like to do every January to get the year started on the right path:

1. An in-depth reflection of the past year. What are you grateful for? What questions did you answer? What are you leaving behind? What did you learn? What did you fail at and why?
1. Take a personality test. It will be more or less the same as the year before, but seeing my personality 'objectified' has never ceased to be illuminating.
1. Imagine and try to feel your future self. One year from now, how would it feel to have accomplished the goals you have for this year?
1. #3 but in the negative. One year from now, how would it feel to be worse off than you are today? What do you want to move away from?
