Reddit cofounder, YC alumni, and overall eccentric yet relatable Alexis Ohanian has me thinking about:
1. Automation
2. Transparency and Information Sharing

His idea with automation is to let the computers do what humans are bad at and computers are good at. He talks about this in terms of internal products at his VC firm. I think about it as python scripts. What if I could automate the repetition out of posting this blog I would save 1-2 minutes a day. That's 15 minutes a week. 10 hours a year. 4 days over the next 10 years. That seems meaningful.

The norms around transparency and information sharing are largely not a product thoughtfulness. And the default seems to be to keep your mouth shut and hoard information, even within an organization. Perhaps this was the best strategy for most all businesses in the twentieth century, but maybe many today could benefit from transparency and information sharing. He lays out many compelling upsides.
