This is by no means a hot take, but I look forward to the day when mental health counseling will be as commonplace and casual as taking your car in for an oil change. You don't do it because your car is falling apart. You do it because you know it is the thing to do if you want to avoid breaking down unexpectedly. The same should be applied to mental breakdowns and mental health counseling. 

Perhaps the analogy goes further. Taking your car in for an oil change does not mean anything is inherently wrong with your car or that your car _needs help_. 

And perhaps further yet. Not everyone is or need be interested in car mechanics. And not everyone needs to know how to change their oil. Skilled professionals do it for us and make it look easier than it is.
