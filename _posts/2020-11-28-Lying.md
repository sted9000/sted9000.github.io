Lying by Sam Harris is a short read that Mica and I agree should be kept in sight in our living room and be read annually. Two points that I took away from this read: 

1. The burden of lying is too high. Even if you are purely self-interested, lying is too heavy of a load to carry. Being truthful leaves you with no mental baggage to carry forward. You can come to each interaction knowing you have no past to keep hidden or ground that you can't tread for fear of revealing a past lack of integrity. 
1. We are tempted to lie when we view interactions as transactional rather than relational. If we take the short view, lying often feels right. Whereas if we take the long view, lying feels as though it would be spoiling a shared future.
