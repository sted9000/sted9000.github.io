My professional hero is on the verge of an astounding feat. An epic comeback.

Yet above all his talent, skill, craftsmanship his humility continually stands out to me.

And he has no need to humble - he has _F*&$ You_ money and made it by climbing up the poker mountain from elevation 0000.

And he is good at being humble. He deflects questions about his accomplishments with gratitude and grace.

And he is the good type kind of humble. The aware kind. The kind that allows you to use your powers and talents rather than sitting on the sidelines.

Good luck on Sunday Phil.
