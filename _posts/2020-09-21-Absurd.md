Thomas Nagel's _Absurd_ is a philosophical essay about the absurdity of life.

Life isn't absurd because 'there is no ultimately meaning' (nihilism). That is pretty silly in my opinion.

Life is absurd because we decide to bet a friend that our blog can outlast his, realize that it is silly, and then do it anyway with vigor.

More formally, the things we spend our energy on are at best uncertain to be meaningful and at worst completely arbitrary. We know this to be true. But, in the heat doing them, we completely forget and strive ahead with all our might.

This may not seem comical in our own lives - because we have justifications for doing what we do, but it becomes a laughing matter what someone else's enthusiasm over something you care nothing about is made clear. The emotions and chanting at a sporting event to the non-sports fan or a 4bet bluff hand-history to the non-poker player.

Life is absurd and wonderful.
