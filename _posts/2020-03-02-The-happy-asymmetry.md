Concisely, love never requires reasons, anger does.

Poetically, anger rests atop a tall weak foundation of faulty logic, ready to crumble. Love floats.

Rationally, there is always a reason you are angry. But our best understanding of how the world works undermines all reasons completely - it could be no other way. When I can be no other way, anger dissipates, love does not.
