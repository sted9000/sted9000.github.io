Formalize the Freerolls... It occurred to me today that Freerolls are a great tool for people like me. I recently took a personality test and (again) rated in the bottom 2 percentile of industriousness: I get distracted and am bad at doing what I set out to do.

1. Six-pack at some point in 2021: I have gifted that to my good friend Andy Whetzel with whom I have been making fitness bets for more than a decade. He gives action back and is a good (and very sarcastic) cheerleader. 
1. Marathon in 2021: I will give this to my blogging mafia member Jonny Spicer. He has been taking his health seriously as of late (which has been joyful to watch) and could even attempt a marathon himself in 2021.
1. Reading 10 Books: I am giving this one to my girlfriend and the most avid reader I know. This is not wise given that she is the one person who could stop me from accomplishing the freeroll. That said, she is always supportive and her love of reading is infectious. 
1. Reduced consumption of Social Media and Inspiration Porn: This one is going to Mr Vos -- my productivity mentor, spiritual guru, and accountability buddy.
