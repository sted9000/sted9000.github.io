So I hit a bonus-hand ($250) while working this week. As a result we splurged and had a 3-course gourmet meal delivered for a Saturday date-night dinner.

I have always had an odd relationship with this aspect of the gambler's lifestyle: When running good, money is no object.

1. I know it makes no sense mathematically. It is all variance. We work for an hourly wage like everyone else.
2. It seems fun and sane to splurge every once in a blue moon. A tribute to the good fortunes bestowed by the poker gods.
3. A penny saved is a penny earned. Yadda-yadda-yadda.
4. It can be communal if you are in a community of other gamblers all living by the same code. Those who are hot, foot the bill. Those who are cold, get a free ride. When luck flips roles are reversed, all without a spoken word.
