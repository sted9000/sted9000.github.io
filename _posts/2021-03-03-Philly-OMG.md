Part of the fun of living in West Philly is the characters you meet on the street. Some are so outrageous that after the fact you imagine them more as cartoon characters than as actual human beings. 

Yesterday walking to the park a young ~20 y/o girl with braces and a cute baby in the back seat called for my attention. She was parked on the street and her drivers' side door wouldn't open from the inside. I tried it from the outside without any luck. While she was busy frantically explaining the issue to her phone, I reached my hand in the window and toggled the lock up and down, and then tried the door again. It opened.

So far, not anything blog-worthy to write about. But then...

Before I knew it, she bolted out of the car started shouting OMG OMG OMG HOW DID YOU DO THAT OMG OMG... After her excitement trailed off a smidge on the tenth OMG, I chuckled a little bit, wished her a nice day, and gave frank the command to move on. 

I don't think I have ever heard anyone say OMG without sarcasm. This West Philly character managed to change that in a very comical way.
