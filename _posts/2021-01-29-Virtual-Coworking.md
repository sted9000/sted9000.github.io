A friend and I have been _virtually coworking_ together over the last week. Here are my initial impressions and predictions.

1. Calling someone and not needing to say one word is strange and refreshing. More group activities in life should be done without the need to speak.
1. The thought "I am on camera, I should stay on task" does not explicitly cross my mind, but the feeling that normally comes along with those kinds of thoughts is felt.
1. Even though we are working on our separate projects and are hundreds of miles apart, there is a small sense of a common pursuit. 
1. The novelty will wear off a bit, but this activity will stick around. The cost is so low that even the smallest benefit would make it worth doing.
1. _Virtual Coworking_ as a 'thing' will exist in some small way going forward. I look forward to seeing what that looks like.
