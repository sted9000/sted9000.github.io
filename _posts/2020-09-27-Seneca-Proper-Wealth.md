> Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough. - Seneca (On Discursiveness of Reading)

I struggle with enough because I confuse it with envy, greed, and desire. But enough is something different. It is a wholesome and enduring satisfaction with the important. My take is that if you can glimpse this difference, you are lucky and that if you can feel this difference, you are blessed to have wonderful people in your life.
