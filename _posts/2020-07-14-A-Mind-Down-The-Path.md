I am very curious about what a mind is like very far down the meditative path. Brain studies show physical changes, but that does not get at all to "what it would be like" to have an enlightened brain.

Relistening to a very experienced meditator and meditation teacher yesterday, he reluctantly answered a few questions that gave a glimpse into his mind. The matter-of-fact manner and the humility in which he spoke, in my mind, gives a lot of credibility to his claims.

He said that there is a date in time where his sense of self left him and has not returned. He still has thoughts, desires, and the rest, but when he looks for his "self" - a center to his experience - it is never there.

It is hard for me to make much sense of his description of his experience. But the act of imagining and simply knowing that a permanently egoless state of mind exists is very very cool.
