In a strange and rare moment yesterday my mind bounced from _that doesn't make any sense_ to _Ohhh, I like that about myself_. Let me attempt to explain.

I had just finished expressing how I love that I walk everywhere in my life, when I was expressing that one of the things I was looking forward to in the next couple years is the fact that I will spend a lot of time driving.

Enter, _that doesn't make any sense_.

Split second...

Enter, _wait, that is actually pretty cool. I am not attached to one or the other, rather, I can find joy in taking advantage of both when appropriate_.
