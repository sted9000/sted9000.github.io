I don't quite know how to think about the power of ideas. On one hand, I have seen how they have the power to rip apart friendships and families. On the other, we are hit with many brilliant and wise ideas regularly that make little to no impact on our lives. 

I think I have a good rule of thumb to guard against the problem of ideas tearing people apart: ideas are never more important than people. But I have no solution to the latter problem of not being able to incorporate wise ideas. 

It is not exactly that I want to be the host to ideas, but that I want to be able to incorporate ideas that I believe in more easily. It is one thing to believe in an idea, but quite another to play out the idea in your life.
