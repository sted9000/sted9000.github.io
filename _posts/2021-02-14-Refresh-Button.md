I have started training for my Marathon Freeroll. While I can't honestly say it is fun, I am finding it is calming and refreshing.

By 3 or 4 pm I am usually spinning my wheels on a problem that fresh eyes would resolve in a minute. That spinning my wheels sensation is now my cue to lace up and hit the pavement.

Sometimes I think linearly and logically when running, but mostly my mind wanders to and fro with mundane and normal thoughts. When I return home I am in a very different physiological state which causes me to feel happy to have gone and happy to be returning to my work-station with fresh eyes. 

I am beginning to believe that the actual marathon will be the least meaningful part of the whole endeavor.
