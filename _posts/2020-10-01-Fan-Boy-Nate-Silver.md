Article by article I am becoming a Fan Boy of Nate Silver. His book influenced my thought in my formative years (now I am old and stubborn) and his site, FiveThirtyEight, is inspiring. His rigor, nerdiness, valuing communication, and humility all shine through in his latest few projects concerning the 2020 Election. And his overarching thesis is that data is a beautiful mess and that cleaning it up is as much art as science is just plain cool.
