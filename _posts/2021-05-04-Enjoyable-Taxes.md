Doing my taxes this year was a pleasurable afair. I turned it into a game and rewarded myself for sitting down and getting it done. Yesterday afternoon with a beer and collecting all my records. This morning a blueberry fritter while downloading all the forms. And a burrito this afternoon after sending the payment and shipping the documents. Combine these delights with an awesome computer, a few walks with Frank to clear my mind, and owing less than anticipated and you can say it was a day well spent. I can't believe I am saying this: I am looking forward to next year's taxes.
