Friends and family members have come to some beliefs that I believe are wrong and harmful. While this is common nowadays, I imagine asking one's self "What should I do about this?" is not. In my view, it is a necessary and complicated question. Necessary because friends and family are too precious to lose over mere differences in belief. Complicated because communication is difficult and the consequences of one's beliefs, while real, are up for debate.

Some questions I am finding myself thinking about while attempting to decide on the larger question of "What should I do about this?" include:

- Is holding this belief very harmful (to them and others)?
- Could we engage on this topic in good humor?
- Am I educated on the matter at hand?
- How much time, energy, and attention is this worth?
- Am I genuinely curious about the matter?

Anyways, as of now, zero relationships have been destroyed and it has all been in good fun. That said, time along with how well I follow my own advice will be the scorecard in the end.
