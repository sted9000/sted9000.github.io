Learning #2 from Carl Rogers

> The more I am open to the realities in me and in the other person, the less do I find myself wishing to rush in to "fix things."

I love this because it goes against everything we are ever taught - to find the problem and fix the problem. I have found that while rushing into fixing things always seems to be right, it seldom works. Fixing things does not fix them. Rogers continues

> Yet the paradoxical aspect of my experience is that the more I am simply willing to understand and accept the realities in myself and in the other person, the more change seems to be stirred up.

The Hallmark card would say _be yourself_, but I think it is slightly more complex. My card would read something like _do the work to be yourself._
