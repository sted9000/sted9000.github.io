I take pride in and get pleasure from my morning routine. A mix of connection, digital hygiene, fulfilling commitments, and simple small pleasures all done in a relaxed and curated way. My Way.

That said I am sure that at some point in my life I want my dad's morning routine. And on days like today I miss sharing it with him.

Wake up before the rest. Settle into your spot in the den (a place with multiple comfy chairs and a great sofa) with a hot beverage and a blanket. Wake up slowly with near silence - occasionally a bird chirping, or a floorboard creaking with someone above contemplating getting out of bed, and maybe the sound of your father turning a newspaper or cookbook's page. Talking is completely optional and the exception rather than the rule. Conversations are always kind, thoughtful, gentle, and slow.

Another cup of coffee.
