A general rule of thumb that I learned from David Brooks is that you want to work _along the grain_ of human nature rather than against it. The idea is that while much of the world yields to pressure and work, human nature is pretty entrenched and doesn't budge. Ideas and ambitions that have forgotten to take this into account have more often than not failed to materialize.

Which brings me to my latest obsession, sleep. It turns out to be very important and I suspect that much of our _success_ in life is due solely to our ability to do it well.

My sleep is strange. While I get tons of deep sleep (associated with physical recovery), I struggle to reach even fifty percent of the recommended amount of rem sleep (associated with mental recovery and performance).

So I wonder if I'm working against the grain by choosing a profession in _knowledge work_? Should I be using my body rather than my mind to earn a living? Surely I would not be the first person to _waste_ their working life struggling against the grain. However it is conceivable that I could be the first to understand why I was working against the grain and do it anyway. Ha.
