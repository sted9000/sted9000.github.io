Idea: Comedy as a lubricant[1] for changing hearts and mind.

This is by no means a new idea, but it is one that I am coming to appreciate more and more. My guess is that it works primarily for two reasons. First, nobody changes his or her mind when their guard is up; laughing lowers your guard and shows you that the person using the humor is not out for blood. Second, humor usually has both the elements of something unexpected and something true; both are also elements of a changing mind.

[1] 7 years of lube jokes in middle and high school wonâ€™t allow me to say this word with a perfectly straight face.
