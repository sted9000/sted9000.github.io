I have attempted three posts tonight and I still have diddly-squat. I have a bit of blog-burnout as of late and am ready for the inspiration to come back. Life is inwardly exciting and intense as usual, but I don't have the perspective or skills to pour it on to the page. At this point, the blog goes on solely as a practice of discipline and stubbornness until the muse returns.
