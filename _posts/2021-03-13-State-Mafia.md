The Blogging Mafia is alive and well: I have managed to post for over 400 consecutive days (winning thousands of dollars along the way), [JonnySpicer](https://jonnyspicer.com) published a beautiful, upgraded, and hand-crafted Hugo site, and silencevosh has started his [adventures in tweeting](https://twitter.com/avminnesota) while his new blog is in the works.

Predictions / Hopes for the rest of 2021:
- My Dad joins the mafia and has a food v-blog by the end of the year. 
- I will shamelessly copy Jonny again and move my blog to Hugo and AWS.
- Our writing gets better over time and it brings us even more joy.
- I will finally publish my ez-blogging utility.
- Guest posting will become a thing.
