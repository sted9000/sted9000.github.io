Perhaps it is recency bias, or perhaps it is because he is my favorite comedian, but I am giving the Podcast of the Year Award to Jerry Seinfeld on The Tim Ferriss Show. Entertaining and full of my kind of wisdom -- very simple and practical.

1. CONFRONT IT.
1. Systematize. Start with what you can do. And reward yourself for doing it.
1. Treat your brain as you would a stupid dog.
1. Flip back and forth between extreme nurturer and harsh critic -- nurturer when you do the work, critic when you edit it.
1. "My entire professional life is concentration fatigue. I am constantly hitting the wall".
1. "Pain is knowledge rushing in to fill a void with great speed".
1. "If I got up there [on stage] and tried, it's a win".
1. Just work!

It is worth a listen.
