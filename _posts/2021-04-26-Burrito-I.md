Today on my morning walk I was hit by inspiration to solve a major problem in my life. Burritos are wonderful, but I have become disenchanted with chipotle. Lunch for mica and I costs $25 and the service is mediocre at best. And while I love their burritos, they are by no means perfect. So I am going to create the worlds best burrito. This will be a long and delicious journey. First I want to gather some good data. So I will be visiting chipotle today, qadoba tomorrow, and then the local mexican restaurant on wednesday to get a feel for what makes a burrito. Then I will do some googling to learn from those who have traveled down this path before me. I am sure they have much to teach. Then the experimenting will begin. Part of what makes a burrito so great is the large number of ingredients so the experiments will be numerous: tortilla, meat, salsa, guacamole, lettuces, cheese, ... Also I love the practicality of the burrito. It is large enough to fill a my stomach, I can eat it with my hands, it can be relatively healthy, and you can make burritos for all types of eaters (veg, dairy free, paleo, high protein). 

So here we go.
