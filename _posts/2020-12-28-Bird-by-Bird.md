Striking eerily similar notes to Jerry Seinfeld's recent appearance on the Tim Ferriss Show, Bird by Bird was down to earth, inspiring, and good for a few laughs.

Three take-aways:
- First and foremost, do the work. Sit down and write. Doing this consistently is where the magic happens.
- Second, quiet your inner critic when you are writing (by any means necessary).
- And finally, writing is not only a craft but also a way of being in the world. When you write daily, everything becomes material. And that means that you start to pay attention.
