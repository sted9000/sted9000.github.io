I am a Fan Boy of Vitalik -- the founder of ethereum. He is much of what I aspire to be and I can see hints of my personality in him: 

- He really doesn't care about the money for fame or status or power. He cares about it for it's utility to do good in the world. 
- He engages with the world out of sense of curiosity.
- He seems genuinely intelectually fearless yet supremely humble. 
- He writes.
- He is an expert developer.
- He doesn't mind learning tough things.
- He is a strange dude and owns it completely.

His [latest blog post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/02/18/election.html) highlights many of the traits above while discussing a topic close to my heart -- The 2020 Election and Prediction Markets.
