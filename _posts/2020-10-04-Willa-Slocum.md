I laid eyes on my newborn niece today. Precious is the word that comes to mind. She is precious and for no other reason than she is my niece. The logic of "just because" now makes perfect sense. I love her not because we will share many memories, tears, and laughs together (although those will be great). I love her "just because".

Welcome to the world Willa Slocum.
