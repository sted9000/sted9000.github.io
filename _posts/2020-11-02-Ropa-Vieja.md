Willa, last night was your first night of Ropa Viaja. Your Grandpa cooked up one of his classics and it didn't disappoint. 

Your Grandma was in pain, discomfort, and distress. She just had major oral surgery and made the mistake of trying to eat non-liquid food. Let this be one of the many lessons you learn from her.

Your Uncle Ryan and Aunt Kassy used the setting as an informal counseling session (as usual) and they were quite hilarious I must say. Ryan defending his new calling as a home contractor and Kassy just shaking her head in acceptance and love of his insanity. Aunt Kassy was struggling a bit with the upcoming 2020 elections, covid19, and the stresses other million stresses of life. She will be just fine though. 

Your momma was tired. Don't forget to thank her for all the diapers and late nights and early mornings of feeding you. I have a feeling she is going to be a gentle, caring, and kind mother. Unequaled by most. 

You were so very small. Just beginning. Coming to life. Just wonderful.
