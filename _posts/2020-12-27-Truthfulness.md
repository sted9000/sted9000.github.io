Truthfulness is a great guiding principle. It is the right decision 99.9% of the time. The general rule of thumb is "unless the Nazis are at your door asking if Ann Frank is in your attic, choose truthfulness." 

This is not to say that truthfulness comes without downsides. Feelings will inevitably be hurt. Your intention will not always be seen.

I did not feel well today. I got a rapid covid test (negative). However, to be extra careful, I still moved out of my grandfather's house until I get a more reliable test result and feel 100%. Telling him this inconvenient truth surely ruined his evening and caused "undue" suffering. I was tempted to tell a lie but did not. 

Small wins.
