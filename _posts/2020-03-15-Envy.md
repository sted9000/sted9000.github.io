The hippie mind thinks that envy and admiration are different in kind. Envy is not deep, meaningful, or healthy. Admiration is.

The practical mind thinks that they are probably very closely related psychologically and that the difference is more fluff that substance.

Anyways... this weekend finding myself covered in envy-admiration, I was struck multiple times by the feeling that I still not who I want to be.

And that is quite okay by me.
