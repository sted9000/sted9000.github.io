I have done _Morning Pages_ for a week now and want to capture my initial thoughts. Morning Pages is pretty much what it sounds like: 3-5 stream-of-consciousness hand written pages in the morning.

1. It takes about an sixty to seventy minutes.
2. Some days topics come effortlessly, others it takes about five second to come up with the next topic.
3. Once I start with a topic, I can go on and on. The hard part is starting.
4. Sometimes I think about what I wrote that morning throughout the day, other days I can't remember if I tried.
5. I grip the pen like a someone is trying to take it from me. Need to relax my hand somehow.
6. It is nice to not need to make sense with your writing.
7. When stuff doesn't make sense. Alarm-bells go off and you can write _that didn't make any sense, let's try again_.
8. Some ideas go away after you write them down, others come alive (this idea is from NN Taleb).
9. Funny how your mind can jump from work to relationships to the weather without any need for a segue.
