With the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) ongoing and especially slaughtering psychology, I believe it is fair for a lay-person like myself to say "we don't know anything about human psychology". Of course this is a wild over-generalization, but what do we know with any degree of certainty?

The place I want to start - because it seems both interesting and on solid grounds empirically - is personality. Personality can be viewed from the lens of psychometrics - the study concerning the theory and technique of psychological measurement - and is more grounded in math and data than most other psychological knowledge I know of. Developmental psychology, human motivation, and social psychology all seem super interesting and important, but at the moment it is hard to know what you can trust and build upon.

So I am going to take a look at the psychology of personality and see what I find...
