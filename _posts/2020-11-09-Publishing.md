Problem - A large source of shame is the fact that I have not released any programming projects into the world despite wanting to for years. I believe this stems from being self-conscious and distracted. Thoughts such as "this project is so small and inconsequential," "why are you wasting your time?" and "what if nobody likes it?" come up often. And then I distract myself as a remedy. And god knows that 2020 is not an ideal environment if you are susceptible to distraction.

Solution - Change my self talk to that of a professional rather than a novice. The novice can reasonably listen to his limiting thoughts and turn away from his work - after all, it is just a side-project. But a professional must listen to his limiting self-talk and then laugh, brush them off, or power through them. Otherwise, he loses his credentials and identity as a professional. 

More concretely, my solution is to publish two pieces of work by the end of the year. And you, my reader(s), if you will, please be my judge. 

Every day I will sit in front of the keyboard and code, google, sketch, ctrl+a delete, push and pull until I publish. Then I will watch the shame disappear.
