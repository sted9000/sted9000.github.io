A few days after realizing I am an idiot, my girlfriend realized the same fact about herself. Since then we have been both lamenting the many moments that reassure our idiot status and joying the occasional moment of grace or intelligent action. However far we fall further into idiocy or stumble on the path towards enlightenment, it is nice to have a partner ape to struggle putting complete sentences together with and to eat bananas with.
