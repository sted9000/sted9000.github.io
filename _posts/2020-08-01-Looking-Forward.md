Ten things I am very much looking forward to:

1. Becoming an Uncle
1. Hugging my Grandfather
1. My Dad's meatballs
1. Becoming financially independent
1. My own squat rack
1. Walking my dog without a leash
1. My own desk
1. Seeing my girlfriend go to her first day of grad school
1. Hanging out with my parents and siblings
1. Voting in November
