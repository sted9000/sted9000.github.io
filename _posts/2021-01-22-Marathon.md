Freeroll #2 for 2021: Complete a marathon. While I don't particularly enjoy running, it is a great excuse to listen to podcasts, explore a new part of the city, or wear yourself out physically so that you can sit down and focus mentally. Furthermore, completing a marathon seems like an item that every self-respecting crazy uncle (that's me) should cross off their bucket list.

I plan on being smart with my training -- resting, stretching, hydrating, massaging, and sleeping a lot. That said, one can only be so smart while habitually pounding one's joints against city pavement. As the sage Donald J Trump said in his final presidential address: "Luck is a very important word," and I will be counting on my never ceasing good physical luck to continue.

Philadelphia's Marathon is scheduled for November 21st.
