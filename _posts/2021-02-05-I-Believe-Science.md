_I Believe in Science_ is an in vogue declaration. The problem with it might be that anyone can find experts, published papers, scientists, and heads of departments that take opposite sides of consequential issues. This reduces _I Believe in Science_ to _I know how to use google_. 

The solution is to have institutions that are unquestionably above board. Implementing the wisdom of crowds and impartiality to important topics.

This is why Trump sucked monkey balls. He played games with institutions. The institutions had to play ball or they risked losing funding, getting bad-mouthed by the president, or worse (ie death threats). These games have lowered institutions "above board" status. 

We need better and stronger institutions -- to the point where _I Believe in Science_ is not a thing.
