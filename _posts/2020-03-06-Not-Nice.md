Most of the time when you say _too soon_, _not cool_, or _that's just not right_ you never actually ever think of the thing that caused the reaction again.

Today that is not the case.

This morning I received this image just as my appetite was coming alive.

The sender knew full well how much I enjoy Mrs Rowe's Cherry Pie and that I have no reasonable way of satisfying the mouth-watering-desire that the image would surely cause.

My belly is rumbling and my mouth is still watering hours later.

_Not cool_.
