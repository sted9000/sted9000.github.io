Mica's grandfather wants to travel from Argentina to visit us here in Philadelphia. HE IS 86 YEARS OLD. Along with traveling to far off lands he plans of studying italian, performing a french play, and is really hoping that his gym opens back up soon.

A lot of people say "I wouldn't like to live forever", but if I could live with Mica's grandfathers spirit, sign me up for at least 200 years. It is people like him that inspire me when I am tired and give me hope when I am down.

Thanks Abuelo.
