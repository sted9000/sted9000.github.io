1. Understanding the nature of time (from a human perspective) is perhaps one of the most useful tools in life, but we have no chance of deeply understanding it.
1. Most of the people you care about are going to be deeply ordinary and mediocore. Choose to see the best in them. Help their mediocrity by leading by example.
1. The Goldsteinian wisdom of _there are multiple levels_ is helpful when thinking about compassion. On the deepest level, everyone deserves endless compassion. On another level, people derserve exactly the relationships and outcomes they earn.
1. _Fuck your inner bitch voice_ is not only funny but very wise advice. We have multiple voices/selves in our mind. Don't pretent your inner bitch is not part of you -- she is. Pay attention when she opens her mouth and then proceed to beat the shit out of her or tell her to shut the fuck up you crazy bitch.
1. Confront the problems in your life. It is unintuitve, but facing conflicts head on and full steem (with confidence, humility, and compassion) is the way to a conflict-free and equanamous life. I continue to learn this the hard way.
1. If you can't learn enough to be wise in an area (hint: you can't be wise in all the things that matter) then use trust as a proxy for wisom. Just copy people you trust in that area.
