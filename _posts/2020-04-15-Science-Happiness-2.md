_Still_ a great podcast - [The Science of Happiness](https://samharris.org/podcasts/196-science-happiness/).

A [cool long-term study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/) following both harvard graduates and inner-city men shows that social relationships are maybe **the most important** factor regarding happiness though peoples lives.

> The surprising finding is that our relationships and how happy we are in our relationships has a powerful influence on our health,” said Robert Waldinger, director of the study, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. “Taking care of your body is important, but tending to your relationships is a form of self-care too. That, I think, is the revelation.

This should have a profound impact of how we think about happiness, longevity, and overall well-being. Along with making sure we exercise regularly, eat well, and get enough sleep we should also make sure to that we are hanging out with friends, calling family daily, and connecting with your community. Not only because of the joys it brings, but also because it is good for our health.

Another semi-related point is that our orientation towards strangers is also a good predictor of happiness. Opening a conversation while in line at the coffee shop doesn't feel like it will bring us happiness, but studies suggest that it does.

Both of these happiness facts play into a general happiness theme: Our intuitive and inner voices are not always good guides to the good life.
