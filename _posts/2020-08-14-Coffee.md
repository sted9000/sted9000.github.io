My partner verbally rolls her eyes every time I bring up my complicated relationship with coffee. So the blog is where I need to work out my thoughts.

1. It is not clear that it tastes good or if the dopamine is just being perfectly timed knowing that in minutes you will be awake, alert, and floating on cloud-nine.

2. It fucks me up - but subtily. I don't realize it during the day, but when I am ready to sleep at night I notice my heart racing. I wake up the next morning not so much from a nights sleep as from a few hours of being blacked out.

3. I love the way it makes me feel. I struggle with collecting and focusing my mind. Coffee really really helps.


My unresolved issues are:

1. Can I have the upside while limiting the downside.

2. If not, which is better.

3. Smaller doses?

4. Does it make sense at times or does following a strict rule work better

5. Does the daily timing of consumption really matter?

6. Can I get tested for "caffeene matabolism".
