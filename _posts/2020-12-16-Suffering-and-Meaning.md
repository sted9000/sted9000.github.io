You can find meaning in suffering. I think this is pretty evident. However, this evident fact can be hijacked without making a necessary distinction: Unavoidable suffering can be meaningful; unnecessary suffering is not meaningful - it's mental illness. 

Perhaps it is worth thinking about which category the suffering in your life falls under. If it is the first, try try try to fix it. If it is the second, take solace in the fact that suffering is somehow - amazingly - not wholly negative. You can find meaning in it.
