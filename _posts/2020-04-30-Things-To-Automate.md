Thinking more about automation on a personal level, I'm finding myself wondering how far I could take this? And how far is too far?

Things I Definitely Want to Automate:
- Retirement Savings
- Tax Record Keeping
- Repetitive tasks such as getting this blog from my computer to yours.
- Rent and Utility Payments

Things I Am Not Sure About Automating:
- Investments
- Recurring Subscription Services (both entertainment and professional)
- Notes from books and podcasts
- Giving to good causes

While the top list loses almost nothing from being automated away, the bottom list does. So the question becomes: Do you want to spend your time with the bottom items?

Wow, the answer is very obviously **NO**. I would rather be thinking or doing many other things (or perhaps not do anything for a few minutes).  

Automate everything!
