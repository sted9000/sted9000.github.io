I had grand visions of returning home and training, educating, and helping my Dad lose weight and regain his health. Folly.

New plan of _attack_: participate with him. On his own, he has started using a calorie counting app to track his intake. I will do the same and play along. No coaching, preaching, or grunting. Simply playing along as an accountability buddy.
