This point seems petty (even for this blog), but I will go with it anyways...

I am starting to catch myself when I think or speak the word "should". It is seldom useful or clear. Sometimes it means that you "want" or feel entitled to something. Other times, the word "will" is a better fit because it is more affirmative and action provoking.  

Examples from today:
- I ~~should have won that hand~~ wanted to win that hand.
- I ~~should~~ will work on my taxes for 15 minutes because I said I would.

In both cases should should not be used. And I leave you a bit dumber than when you started reading :+)
