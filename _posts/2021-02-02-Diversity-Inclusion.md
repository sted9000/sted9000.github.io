Ideas around diversity and inclusion are infused into the 2021 higher-education experience. My girlfriend is in a weekly meeting on this topic and another family member is wrestling with the fact that they might not get a job promotion due to these ideas. 

From the nosebleed section, I have strong opinions on the matter. I will record the general sentiment here and then place my opinions and feelings on hold for the next few years. I will simply see how these ideas unfold for the people around me and try to keep an open mind. 

Point 1: Higher education is the least racist, bigoted, or prejudiced place on earth. Why on earth are you bright people trying to rid the remaining droplets of it from campuses. You could be spending that time and energy doing science. If you thought deeply about the problems you are talking about in diversity and inclusion groups, you would realize your energy is spent better elsewhere.

Point 2: Diversity and inclusion are noble goals, but they are tricky:

- They are unintuitively tough to measure (variance is a bitch).
- Implementing them have costs. If you are optimizing for them, it means you are sacrificing other noble goals.
