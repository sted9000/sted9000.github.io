1. Try all the doughnut shops within walking distance.
1. Order the vegan food the yoga teacher you met on the street promoted.
1. Buy fruit from the back of a truck
1. Run in the river-side park
1. Meet all your floormates/neighbors
1. Attend a public lecture
1. Be inspired by those less fortunate than yourself
1. Be inspired by those who have more than you
1. Shop at WholeFoods
1. Shop at the Arab Grocery around the corner
