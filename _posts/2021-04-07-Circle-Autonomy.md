In part, _the circle of life_ is about autonomy. Infants can't make decisions for themselves and neither can most towards the end of life. But it is hard to revoke someone's autonomy once they (the elderly) have had it. Their ego holds on to it too tight and for too long. This is something I want to remember in my old age: there comes a time to let go of being the complete author of your life. 

Atwal Gwande (99% spelling that incorrectly) puts a positive spin on this fact. He asserts that autonomy can be broken up into two parts: the larger story of your life and the smaller practicalities. He says that the wise give up the latter when the time is right, but everyone gets to hold on to the former until the very end.
