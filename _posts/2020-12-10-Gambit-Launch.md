Here is a cross post from a site I have in the works. Tomorrow a beta version should be hosted and I will post the link HERE:

Gambit PLO was launched in late December 2020. The site was built for players like myself who are looking for methods of improving without much overhead. Visually seeing what the solver does on the button with all AJxx combos and taking preflop quizzes are not poker panaceas. However, I believe they can help you improve quickly and cheaply - picking the low-hanging fruit.

The launch is personally exciting because it is my first professional development project (that also makes it a bit scary). It is also a long time coming as I have been tinkering with it since WSOP 2019 - which feels like forever ago. 

I wanted to get this tool out into the world and will be adding more data more features shortly - stay tuned.

I hope you enjoy Gambit PLO,
Ted
