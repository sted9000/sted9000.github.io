Two smiles caught my eye this week. My grandfather smiled when my dog Frank jumped up on his bed, gave him a few licks, and plopped down at his side. My niece of three months curled her lips up too for the smallest smile you could imagine.

I noticed the first because I can't remember the last time I saw him smile and I bet I won't see too many more. I noticed the latter because it was, hopefully, the first of many.
