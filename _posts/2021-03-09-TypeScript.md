I am officially jumping on the TypeScript bandwagon. For anyone unfamiliar, it is a more verbose JavaScript (the programming language of the web) that enforces a stricter set of standards. 

Here are a few points that have finally convinced me to start writing TypeScript:

- It will help your entry learning a wide array of other languages.
- It significantly cuts down on bugs before any code has been run.
- The learning curve is not steep if you are already familiar with JavaScript.
- While it is more verbose (requires more keystrokes), it saves you time with a much smarter editor through autocomplete and suggestions. 
- The _typing_ and stricter standards gain importance the larger the team of developers gets.
