A few unoriginal thoughts on being alone:

- It is often uncomfortable to say "I need to be alone" to those around you. They could take offense. "You don't give me enough." "You consume too much of me."
- It is seen by many as an act of defiance against society.
- It is an opportunity to _meet yourself_ and the you that you meet will likely be a stranger.
- It is uncomfortable in part because all the blame and excuses you attribute to other people are stripped away.
