I got my first covid vaccine shot today. There is a lot of talk in my family about not getting the vaccine. Here are my reasons doing so:

1. I don't want to personally get anyone sick.
1. I want to do my part to stop the spread of the disease. I believe we all need to stop being so self-centered and this is a chance to walk the walk.
1. I am not so cynical as to think that the government knowingly is harming all of its citizens for nebulous nefarious reasons.
1. The long-term risk of the vaccine is largely unknown -- new technology not tested over a long period. However, that needs to be weighed against the alternative (and the long-term effects of covid is also largely unknown). 
1. Krispy Kreme is giving out a free donut to vaccine recipients. 

Thank you scientists, healthcare workers, and ... I love America.
