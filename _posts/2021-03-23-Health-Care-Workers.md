Health-care worker's ability to have seemingly egoless interactions for years on end is marvelous. They are there simply to help the patient. They switch into a mode where their wellbeing and dignity go offline. It is incredible. 

I have a hypothesis as to why anyone would choose to do this: The dignity and wellbeing gained from receiving gratitude and appreciation for your help more than compensates for the sacrifices.

I would love to get many veteran health-care workers take on my hypothesis. Weed brownies, psychedelic trips, or margaritas might be needed because most I would imagine aren't as sappy or sentimental as I am. But perhaps I could start by just asking and see what I get.
