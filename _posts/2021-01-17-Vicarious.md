I have been finding joy living vicariously through people -- my sister going to Mexico for a needed vacation, my older brother becoming a father, and now my friend starting a new job tomorrow. It is not happiness for them, but I feel a bit of what I imagine they would be feeling -- a deep sense of relaxation with my sister, a parental delight with my brother, and the nerves and excitement with my friend. 

_Living vicariously_ has been coded as negative in my mind. Until now.
