Bitcoin has been on a tear recently. The thing that sticks out to me is the impulse to check the price multiple times a day and how it is the exact pattern that occurred with bitcoin's 2017 bull run. While I would argue that my overall mental health is somewhere near an all-time high, this negative impulsive behavior remains.

Three things that I take away from this: 
1. I still have too much of my energy tied up in wealth and finances.
1. Impulse control is still a 'problem' for me.
1. My mental health has a lot more upside potential (as does this bitcoin bull run, haha).
