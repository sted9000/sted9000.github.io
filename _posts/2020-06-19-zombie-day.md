Today was weird. A calm and uninterested day. Nothing was pleasant or unpleasant, interesting or uninteresting, for more than a moment or two before I returned to baseline zombie-mode.
While I don't want any more days like this one, I can't say it was a bad day. It was a day with a good coffee, a day where I was productive, and a day of receiving much love.
