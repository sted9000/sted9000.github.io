Another prediction: Joe Biden wins by a decent margin in November.

Current odds have him as a slight dog (5/4) to Trump (1/1). My thinking is simpleminded. Last election was a freak event. Over the last 4 years we have forgotten that fact. People like myself did not vote for two reasons 1- Because Hilary was going to win anyway and 2- Because Hilary was an unlikable candidate. Neither of those reasons apply now.

I don't like Biden as a candidate, but I predict he will win comfortably.

Post forthcoming when I put my money where my mouth is.
