I am getting tired of people around me talking about money as if it were the holy grail. I understand -- it is easy to imagine how your life would be better if you had more of it. But in reality, your life would be only marginally better. Not _mo money, mo problems_, but rather more money, same problems. That should be clear as day.

And while it is easy to imagine how much better off you would be if you had 2x the wealth you have now, it is much harder to imagine the life you would have if your mental health was 2x better.

Perhaps this is just a problem of imagination.
