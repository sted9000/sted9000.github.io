I like having _simple_ as an objective.

_Simple_, to me, is a close cousin to tranquility, virtue, compassion, meaning, and beauty.

The problem with _simple_ is that the world is not so. _Simple_ can always be effectively undermined by one word - why - leading to the messiness and complexity of the world.

So the goal can't be simply _simple_. It is more like containing the complexity of the world in your version of _simple_.
