Having been reminded of my natural over-conservativism (cowardice), today I looked at my professional risk-of-ruin. Before doing the calculations I guessed that it was very very very low (literally one in a million). Turns out I am not as 'risk-averse' as I thought. I only go broke one in 250,000 lifetimes.

Tomorrow, if I get the courage, maybe I will think of some strategies to raise my risk-of-ruin to a respectable number.
