I am starting to believe that the way you treat yourself (your self-talk if you will) is the largest determining factor of your life's outcome. 

Why, now 30 years old, am I just starting to believe this? I don't know. It all of a sudden seems obvious. Of course, the way you talk to yourself matters - we are talking to ourselves all-day every-day. What's more is the way we talk to ourselves can run the full spectrum from hateful to grateful, from delusional to humble, and from unkind to unconditionally generous and for no discernable reason at all. 

Why not choose the grateful, humble, and generous? Why not be empowering? Why not be compassionate towards yourself so you can then someday maybe be compassionate towards others. What do you have to lose? After all, you are only talking to yourself.
