I remember arriving in India. Kolkata. Alone. Three days in a jarring new world. But, jarring as it was, what sticks with me has nothing to do with India. Rather, it is an idea from a small book.

The idea: free will doesn't exist. This topic takes people more skilled in communication than I hours to unpack (so I will not be so silly as to attempt it here). But what I will say is that in the 5+ years that have followed, the idea morphed from "Holy crap, I think this is right and my world is permanently upside down" to "Yep, that's right. Next order of business..."

Now I want to explore this idea from the experiential side rather than the intellectual one. NO, I AM NOT SAYING I WANT TO MEDITATE. I am saying I want to explore how the feeling of free will is never present in the first place if you care to pay attention.

I can be here, behind the keyboard, typing these words, without having the feeling that I am free to choose the next words that I do. In fact, if you are paying attention, that is the only way that it can feel.

Almost always I am _under the impression_ that I freely choose the next words I type. I am now semi-convinced that it never actually _feels_ like a free choice. This is what I am curious to explore.
