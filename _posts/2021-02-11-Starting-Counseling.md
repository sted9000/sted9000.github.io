Documenting my thoughts before counseling:

- I am a bit uncomfortable talking about important subjects, as I sound silly. My lack of clarity regarding important subjects seems childlike.
- It will be nice doing it from the comfort of my own home.
- What I most desire is clarity of thought that will lead to better outcomes for me and my loved ones.
- I want to watch for how dishonest I am tempted to be. When that urge comes up, I want to pay attention.
- The quote that I am taking into this is "Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."
- While I am uncomfortable, I am also excited. I am not sure if it is nervousness, anticipation of resolved dilemmas, or the narcissistic joy of starting every sentence with "I".
