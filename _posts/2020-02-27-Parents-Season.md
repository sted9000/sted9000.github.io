My parents are starting to talk about entering the latter part of their lives. And while this brings about a sense of sadness, on the whole, it is quite warming. You can see that their minds slowly trying to make sense of the new season of their lives. Rather than being driven by survival, get-ahead, and show-my-status motives, they are going to experience a new set of motives around legacy, pride, and caring. 

I am very much looking forward to watching them as they experience this new thing at an old age.
