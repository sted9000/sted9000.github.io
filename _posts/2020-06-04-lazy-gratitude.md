I am unsure of what to write about today and unmotivated to struggle with anything worthwhile.

So I suppose that given my bland mind and my low energy mood, gratitude would be a suitable option.

I am grateful for all the people trying to make a positive change in the world. I think most of you are nuts (in a lovely way), but I truly admire collective effort and togetherness.

I am grateful for my awesome dog Frank who takes me on many walks.

That's all I can muster today folks. Until tomorrow, be well.
