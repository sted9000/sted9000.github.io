Triage - the assigning of priority order to projects on the basis of where funds and other resources can be best used, are most needed, or are most likely to achieve success.

Poker forces you to understand the importance of triage. While playing, there are hundreds of things you could be focusing on; you should only think about the high priority ones. While studying, there are hundreds of things you could be learning; you should only study the high priority ones. If you get overwhelmed by the options and chaos while playing, you will make losing decisions. If you fail to prioritize your study, you won't improve and be overtaken by the competition.

Life is the same. We have hundreds of viable options, projects, and complaints at all moments. We must let almost all of them die on the field in order to save any at all.

Our psychology has helped us out in a big way by blocking out most all options most of the time through habits, routines, and a mind that is pretty repetitive in nature. But there are times when your unlimited options are apparent and triage is needed.

Today is my day off and I had a list of about 100 things I wanted to do. Typing this silly blog made the cut of about 10 that survived the triaging.
