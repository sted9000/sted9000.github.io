Lately, I have been wondering about kindness. Is it a fundamental value? Or is it trivial and shallow? I have landed squarely on the former. Genuine kindness is worth striving towards and cherishing. It is one of the deepest and warmest emotions there's on the menu. Order more whenever you can.

Someone I love dearly is going through a rough patch and could use some more tenderness, love, and, well, kindness. And while struggling people are not always fun to be around, they are giving you a gift - the opportunity to be kind. Sadly, I did not do a great job of this today.

Kindness seems cool because it is mutually exclusive to pride, defensiveness, and pettiness. You can't be kind when thinking about yourself. You can't be kind when you are protecting yourself. And you can't be kind when you are making yourself comfortable.
