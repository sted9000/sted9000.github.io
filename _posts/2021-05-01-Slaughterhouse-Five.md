Book Review: Slaughterhouse Five

I loved it. I don't know why. I don't care why.

My favorite passage: 

> "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference."... Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present, and the future.

A mix of ideas, politics, gore ("so it goes"), and absurd humanity. I didn't want it to end.
