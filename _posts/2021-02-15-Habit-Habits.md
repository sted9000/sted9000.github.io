While attempting to build some good habits this year I am falling back on two learnings from Atomic Habits:

1. Start Small
1. Never Miss Twice

Starting small makes sense intellectually, but goes against my nature. I want it all and I want it now. But this aggressive attitude leads to failure more often than not. On the first day of marathon training, I literally ran around the block. It was a bit demoralizing, but two weeks later I am still running. 

Never miss twice is also a good attitude to fall back on because inevitably you will miss days. I remember the author had a pithy saying along the lines of _missing the second day is that start of a new habit (in the wrong direction)_.  

Keep on roll'n.
