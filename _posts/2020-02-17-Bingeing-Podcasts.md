Bingeing podcasts

I am a fan (bordering on obsessed) with podcasts.

And as is true with most obsessions, terms and conditions for responsible use is generally a good idea.

T&C: Binge, extract, and process interesting ideas while on vacation. For god's sake **do not touch them when in daily life.**

Podcasts capture, distract, and twist my mind with exotic thoughts while my values, goals, and objectives get derailed for weeks at a time.

Good news however, with this bingeing system I am finding myself coming back from vacations energized, productive, more enthused, and less distractible.
