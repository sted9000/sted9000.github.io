I have started reading _Mans Search For Meaning_. My only reaction 50 pages in is an immense gratitude for everything I have. It is sobering to read a first-person account of a concentration camp. Any complaint that crosses my mind the rest of the day gets smacked down with "Am I insane? Am I sure I want to complain about that?". And the coffee and doughnut that was always good but contained a slight bit of guilt is now wholly terrific and utterly guiltless. 

Gratitude makes things taste better.
