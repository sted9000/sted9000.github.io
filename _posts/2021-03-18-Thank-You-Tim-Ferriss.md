Tim Ferriss has had an outsized influence on my life. And having recently released his 500th podcast episode, I believe this is as good of a time as any for a thank you note:

The Four Hour Work Week accompanied me through an amazingly bizarre trip to Budapest. Nights in spooky Airbnbs were manageable in part because I was being hit with new ideas from the book.

I listened to your first four podcasts (they were the only four released at the time) on my solo bicycle journey from Budapest to Vienna. They opened my eyes to the fact that the world is full of interesting people willingly sharing their ideas. Josh Waitskin, Kevin Rose, etc...

I remember reading The Four Hour Body (the part about female anatomy to be specific) in an empty Russian airport restaurant on my way to live in Thailand. The book prompted me to get into the best shape of my life shortly thereafter. 

To be continued...
