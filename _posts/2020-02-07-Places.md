I have swung wildly in the philosophy of _places_.

> "I have the fondest memories of time spent in places called ugly, the most boring ones of places called scenic." -NN Taleb

Possibly moving soon, I am wondering once more, _Does the place matter?_

My current iteration is that place does matter, but it only matters because of its effect on how people interact with each other. Temperature, terrain, density, noise, parks, grassland, beautiful buildings, pollution can all be mapped, however indirectly, to how they effect peoples interactions.
