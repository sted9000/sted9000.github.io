So I got my bet down.

6/5, 2.2, +120. However you think about lines. We bet $1,000 to have $2,200 returned at the inauguration of Joe Biden.  

It is not a comfortable bet. Like I said before, he is a shitty candidate. At times very clumsy with his words. His personality does not say winner. His presence says Senile Grandpa Joe. I don't personally like him. And my girlfriend thinks I'm insane.

That said, I like my bet. He does not need to win. He needs to be the reasonable alternative. An alternative that can restore some sanity. I believe the most relevant factor is how the middle 20% votes. Those who are invested in politics as a form of life and death, or as a form of identity, or showmanship - we already know how those 80+ percent of people are going to vote. My bet is that the other 20% will choose boredom and sanity over a continued morphing of reality into Reality TV.
