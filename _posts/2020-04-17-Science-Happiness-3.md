What does this quotes really mean?

> You can't become happy; you can only be happy.

1. Be present
2. Impact Bias
3. Conditions have little to do with happiness

_Be present_ is the cliche of the decade it seems and the point here is simple. You can be happy now doing many things, but thinking about how you will be happy in the future is not one of them.

_Impact Bias_ is a neat concept from Dan Gilbert. Simply we are bad at anticipating how we will incorporate and recover from future events. Be it the loss of an arm or winning the lottery.

> In a very famous study published by researchers at Northwestern University in 1978 it was discovered that the happiness levels of paraplegics and lottery winners were essentially the same within a year after the event occurred. You read that correctly. One person won a life-changing sum of money and another person lost the use of their limbs and within one year the two people were equally happy.

> It is important to note this particular study has not been replicated in the years since it came out, but the general trend has been supported again and again. We have a strong tendency to overestimate the impact that extreme events will have on our lives. Extreme positive and extreme negative events donâ€™t actually influence our long-term levels of happiness nearly as much as we think they would.

_Conditions_ have little to do with happiness. This is a point that almost all of the ancient traditions got correct and modern psychology is validating. Tools such as framing, mindfulness, negative visualization, a gratitude practice are all likely more important than your current lot in life.

How wonderful, the science of happiness :)
