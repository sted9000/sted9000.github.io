What are some extreme challenges what I would like to undertake? Using criteria to come up with them is hard because, as I hypothesized before, they teach you unexpected things in unexpected ways. So I am left to imagine challenges that _feel_ right and that won't kill me.

A few that I might try (thanks to Vos for helping me brainstorm):

- Go blindfolded for a day.
- Read a book cover to cover without putting it down.
- Run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours.
- Do an extended water-only fast.
- Meditate for 4 hours straight.
- Play a 16 hour poker session without music or distractions.
- Eat only meat for a month.
- Eat clean vegan for a month.
- Do yoga twice a day for a week.
- Run a marathon.
- Go down a YouTube rabbit-hole for a whole week.
- See how many phone-numbers you can get in a day.
- Wear noise canceling earmuffs for an entire day.
