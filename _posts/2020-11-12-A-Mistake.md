A mistake I made with my large bet on the presidential election was that I did not hold any funds in reserve to hedge or press "in-game" (while the voting was taking place on November 3rd). Biden swung from -200 to start the night to +350 as he lost Florida, Ohio, and Texas in the span of a few hours and was trailing in Wisconson, Michigan, and Pennslyvania. At that point, while the map looked grim for Biden, he by no means only had a 22% winning. 

In fact, according to the model I was trusting, Biden was still a slight favorite (56%) after losing FL, OH, and Texas. 

For weeks I had been reading that mail ballots would be counted last, that the map could look "very red" at times on election night, but that a "blue wave" would come when the mail ballots were counted. My curiosity failed me and I failed to connect the dots. I never asked, "what does this novel wrinkle mean?".
