For the first time in a long while I am sleeping well. Along with good sleep comes more and more recognition of the reasons to be grateful for a good night sleep. Near the top of the list is dreaming.

The other night I had an awesome dream. Sean Connery and David Foster Wallace joined me for a street shootout in Argentina and then (the survivors) appeared in my childhood home... It gets weirder from there, as dreams tend to do.

The silliness and incoherence brings me childlike joy. So if you don't want to recognize the importance of sleep for productivity or health reasons, maybe you can for the simple pleasure of dreams.
