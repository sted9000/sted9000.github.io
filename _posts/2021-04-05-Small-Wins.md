I heard a new theory for why I might love morning routines: They give you enough momentum to overcome resistance when you sit down to work. If you pile up enough _small wins_ in the morning, by the time you sit down you will feel unstoppable. 

Luckily, I am in the perfect position to play around with this idea. Tomorrow morning here I come.
