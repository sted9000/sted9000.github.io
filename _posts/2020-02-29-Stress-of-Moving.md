More than once I have been told that moving induces more stress than about any other major life event.

The stress has not yet arrived, but my mind is frantically searching for ways to avoid its arrival indefinitely.

Ideas:
- Always keep in mind (or at least in your pocket) the beautiful reason you are moving.
- Decide what is important during this process. Let the rest fall where it may.
- Good upfront communication and knowing what is important to your partner.
- This is a new chance to decide again what stuff really matters and what stuff to allow into our lives. Be grateful.
- Not every decision is best made together. Delegate where appropriate.
