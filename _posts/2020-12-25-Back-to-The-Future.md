We re re re re re-watched the Back to The Future trilogy over Christmas. Of course, it was entertaining. However, this time through I saw it through more of a philosophical lens. Principally, how a life (or even an entire family) can be dramatically shaped by one event or one trait. And while this idea is in tension with _you are the sum of your experiences_ philosophy that I enjoy, I think it is very inspiring and perhaps instructive.

Marty convinces his father to stand up for himself once. His family is forever changed for the better because that one moment gave his father _the stuff_ to then stand up for himself at all points in the future. 

The Mcflies all can't bear to be called "chicken", "yellow", "scared", or "coward". This inability to think clearly when taunted causes enough chaos and misfortune for the entire trilogy.
