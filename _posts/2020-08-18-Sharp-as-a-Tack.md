Those who know me well, know that I have a mild obsession with old age and death. Another confirmatory data-point here is how incredibly impressed I am by old-timers who are still sharp. I recently listened to a podcast with a 92-year-old who could have passed as a 'with-it' 60-year-old. He was so impressive that I don't remember too much from the conversation because I spent most of it in awe of him. My grandma shocks and inspires me too with her intellect and clarity of mind. She turned 84 a week ago.

How truly great would it be to be 90-years-old, physically healthy, sharp-as-a-tack?
