While I make noises in favor of or rebuking policies made by our recent presidents, I truly don't have strong opinions on almost any. Immigration, foreign affairs, domestic policy, tax rates, are all above my paygrade. 

Tonight, watching an interview of former President George W. Bush, I was struck by his ability to laugh and laugh at himself and something hit me. I don't know if I will ever vote for a president again based on policy. Yes, policy is important, but I am not in a good position to judge policy. I am in a much better position to judge the character and perhaps character matters just as much.
