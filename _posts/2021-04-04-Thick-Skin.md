Something I admire in people is the quality of thick skin without the loss of sensitivity. 

The saying _thick skin_ highlights this point beautifully. You are not easily wounded, but that does not mean that you don't feel the blow or prick on your skin. 

My best guess is that this admirable quality comes from a confluence of traits that might include: healthy self-confidence, a great deal of compassion, and not taking yourself too seriously. 

A reason that I might find this quality fascinating is that I don't personally know a single person who holds it (myself included). We let things wound us when we should simply feel them, learn from them, and then never give them another ounce of our psyche.
