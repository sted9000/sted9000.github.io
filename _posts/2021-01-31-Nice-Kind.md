A saw a tweet a few weeks back that has stuck with me. It went something like

> Best description of West Cost vs East Cost people: People from the West Coast are nice but not kind. People from the East Coast are kind but not nice.

While I often use nice and kind as synonyms, they are very different. Nice is shallow, kind is deeper. Nice is not wanting to offend, kind is actually caring.

The goal is to be kind, not nice. East Coast for the win!
