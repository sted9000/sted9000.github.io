Having been spellbound by this election cycle's forecasting, I am curious about applying the tools and methods to other domains.

What you need:
- Domain expertise
- Data
- A model that captures signals and avoids noise
- A market to bet (against others betting with less knowledge)
- High-frequency events 

The only real downside of elections (from a gambling perspective) is that they happen too rarely.
