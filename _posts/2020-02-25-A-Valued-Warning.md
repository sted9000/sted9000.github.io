Again today a pedestrian warned me about the risk of setting a laptop (effectively a large $1000 bill) in front of you while sipping coffee at an outdoor cafe in the city.

Generally tired of advice of this kind and not willing to engage I thanked him politely - telling him I would be careful but that I really loved being outside in the mornings.

Hopefully this miser would be on his way.

But his reaction gave him away as not a miser or cynic at all. He was simply trying it be helpful. "That I understand" he smiled. He then mimed a scale, shrugged, and was on his way.
