I am attempting a prolonged water-only fast... starting NOW!

This one seems doomed to fail:

- My mind has already come up with multiple excuses to not do it and I am still stuffed from my last supper.
- I am in an environment where I traditionally eat all the time.
- I have not been eating very healthy lately.
- My girlfriend- s on board, but not as enthused with the idea as I am (She actually has things that need to get done).
- There is food in the house. 
- No freeroll has been made.

A prediction here is not valid because the prediction itself could influence the outcome. But if I were to have to put a line on not having eaten between now and Monday evening, I would say 25%. 

Good luck us.
