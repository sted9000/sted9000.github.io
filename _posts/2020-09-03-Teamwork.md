I have been thinking a bit about teamwork in relationships recently. It seems both more complicated and more important since I initially thought.

Complicated because (like everything) it is partly inherited and partly learned. How relatively fixed personalities match, mesh, and collide matters. And so does learning how to be a better team player.

Important because teams are way better than solo acts in almost every endeavor - or they have the potential to be. A good team cannot only be more than two times as productive as two individuals, but can be more than twice as much fun, wise, brave, healthy, kind, content, and almost everything else we care about.

Luck also plays a role in teamwork (like it does in everything). My teammate just landed a sweet gig as a grad-student studying what she loves and getting paid a small constant salary. This allows her teammate (me) to more easily have a variable income, take greater risks, and plan for the long term. This is ideal teamwork and was delivered by luck.

Long live teamwork.
