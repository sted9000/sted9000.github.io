I don't know why I find driving so pleasurable. A few hypothesizes:

- My mind feels free to wander and ponder the strange and absurd
- Moving fast is fun
- The white noise from the car
- The power of handling a big machine
- Comfortable chair
- The extended period of sunlight
- Sipping on coffee
- Silly and pointless conversations
- The feeling of being on watch and alert
- The anticipation of where I am going

Anyway I love it.
