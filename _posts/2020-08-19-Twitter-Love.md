I am starting to value and enjoy twitter. If used intelligently, I think it could be the best form of information currently available to us.

1. It forces ideas to be honed and condensed
1. I is a battleground for ideas
1. You can block the bullshit
1. Re-tweets and likes allow you to expand your circle
1. Authenticity seems to be valued over aesthetics
