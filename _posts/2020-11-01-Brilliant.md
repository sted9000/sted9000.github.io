My friend Vos had the brilliant idea of making the categories of the blog questions - the questions that you want to answer in and with your life. 

Here are my November 2020 questions: 

- What would it feel like to cut the puppet strings of wealth, status, and power? Seeing that it is three days before the election, you can probably imagine who my anti-role-model is. 
- What would it do to your psychology to walk around knowing that you could defend yourself from danger? To be a bad-ass-Chuck-Norris-mother-fucker.
- What would it feel like to be a productive person? 
- What would change if you were a risk-tolerant and non-avoidant person? Could you be that person without turning into an asshole?
- Why do you love America so much? Is it just you and your nostalgia? Or is it something more objective?
- How do you balance the circles of compassion and responsibility? From yourself as an individual, out to family and friends, neighbors, community, nation, world, all beings etc. 
- What type of joy comes along with life-long friendships and intimate relationships?

Cheesy I know.
