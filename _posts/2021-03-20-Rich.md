I know that this point is made often, but I think it is hard to understate: Anybody reading this post is far _richer_ than almost anyone who has lived throughout human history. 

The game this statement makes is to make you think about what _rich_ means. But in almost every way you can define it, you are filthy rich relative to everyone in the history books. 

My Dad bought a boat-load of exotic spices last week for about 0.01% of his yearly salary. That's unprecedented and frankly insane. 

With a lot of rightful pessimism and doom and gloom in the world, it is nice to stop and think about how rich we and everyone we care about all are.
