Another two-way street I was describing the other day is that of our state of mind and the contents of our mind. Our current disposition of the mind affects the content and the content affects the disposition. Our mood alters what we think about and what we think about alters our mood.

Yesterday we ordered a fancy lunch for Patriot's Day (here in Argentina). I saw the two-way street in motion. The delivery was 2 hours late, but since it was from our favorite place, we were not bothered at all.  And since we were in a good state of mind when eating the meal, it tasted wonderful. Content affecting state and state affecting content.

One implication might be that when we are down - when both our state and contents of our mind are negative/unskillful - we have two routes for correction. We can either change the content ("why don't we talk about something else") or we can change the state ("you need to relax" or "I should go for a run").

Maybe another implication of this two-way street is that it can be self-perpetuating (both positively and negatively).

Food for thought. Until tomorrow...
