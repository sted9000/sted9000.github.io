When undercharged for a purchase (cashier mistake for example), what do you do?

Many contradictory righteous feelings come flooding in:
- Surely it is just a make up for the times you were over charged and didn't notice.
- Surely we want to live in a world where honesty and forthrightness prevails.
- I win! I win!
- Surely the cashier was jeopardizing her employment to make a subtle opening to continue our relationship.

To me, this internal drama a great example of how righteous feelings are not our guide to the moral universe and that often they contain more comedy than wisdom.
