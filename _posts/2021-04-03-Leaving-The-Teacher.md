An interesting idea from (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEpe17nPhE]

Educatators take you along on a journey -- somewhere you would not have been able to go without them. But they never tell you when the adventagous part of the journey is over. They just keep on saying "follow me". The wise student knows when to eject because the teacher has no longer is knowledgable.

A great example of this is parents. When you are younger they are invaluable teachers. At a point however, they stop being great teachers. The magic is to know when this point is.
