Rarely am I caught up in the news cycle. However, the reality show that is the upcoming presidential election has drawn me in. I feel as though I am holding my breath and will be for the next four weeks. Twitter, Google News, and the latest polls have been permanently etched into my browser's history.

While I know that it is not sane to be caught up in the news perpetually, I am allowing myself this indulgence. And how could you not? The plot has all the elements of a thriller: a maniac who is unpredictable, the threat of violence, heroes, a deadly disease, magic potions, and who knows what will be added to the mix tomorrow.
