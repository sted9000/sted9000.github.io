Just as I am falling in love with my neighborhood here in Buenos Aires, we are moving. While it was not love at first sight - it has taken my a full year and a half to fall in love - I would proudly defend Colegiales as **the best neighborhood** vs any and all willing challengers.

Just to name a few things it has going for it:

- A great bakery. Which as the factory for all it's franchise locations. This is not a trivial factoid, it means that every day some yummy beautiful treat is on sale. 2 for 1.
- A perfect corner grocery store. Organic, with all the essentials, and rarities to inspire you in the kitchen. Also the owner and staff are lovely.
- Coffee shops on almost every corner.
- Local restaurants.
- Little traffic.
- Tree-lined streets.
- A beautiful plaza.
- Easy access to the rest of the city (train stop, buses, subway, city-bikes).
- Cheap rent.
- Multiple places to get a good burger.
- A fancy restaurant for special occasions.
- Bars of every type.
- Lots of schools.
- The streets are always clean.
- A great co-working space.
- Houses, apartments, townhouses.
- A great yoga studio.
- Cheap gyms, expensive gyms and everything in between.
- NO HIPSTERS

I could go on and on. But the bottom line is that I have loved living here and will remember fondly the life Colegiales.
