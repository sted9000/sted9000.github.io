My grandfather thinks he is nice and send the elevator back down to the first floor on his ride up to his apartment.
The first time I saw this I thought "Ah, that's nice. But WAIT. Why is he sending it to the first floor?".
Let's see:

 - He lives in an 8 story building.

- The lobby is floor 1

The 'nicest' floor to send the elevator to is the one where the average wait is the smallest.

During a trip out of the building everyone leaves their 'average floor' (8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2) / 7.
And everyone returns from the first floor (1).
So the average floor of entry is ((8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2) / 7 + 1) / 2 => 3.

I guess the time matters too though.
If you are the first one out of the building in the morning the equation would obviously change. This highlights the fact that knowing who is in or out of the building matters. Doing the 'nice' thing would then simple be (8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2) / 7 => 5. As everyone is still in the building. And conversely if you think you are the last one out of the building the 'nicest' thing to do would be to simply leave the elevator in the lobby.

ME: "Grandpa you know you shouldn't leave the elevator on the first floor if you are trying to be nice. Usually you should leave it on the 3rd".

GRANDPA: "I don't know many people who carry their groceries back to the supermarket."
