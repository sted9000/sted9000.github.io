Rereading _Into The Magic Shop_ I realize it is the singular book that I wish I had read when I was 15-years-old. 

It provides a wonderful manual and roadmap to the question: How should a real person (with very real problems) traverse through life? It gives a simple guide to specific tools -- meditation and compassion, while also placing those tools inside the adventurous and trying life of the author. It shows how boldness and compassion can play well together.  

In all likelihood, I would have turned my nose up at the book without opening it (much like young Biff in Back To The Future when old Biff gives him the sports almanac), but I strongly suspect it would have altered my little journey in the space-time continuum.

Thank you for writing this book. I will try to remember to give it to my 15-year-old son. 

Review: 10/10 if you are looking for an inspirational, quick, and very to-the-point book prescribing meditation and compassion for shaping your life.
