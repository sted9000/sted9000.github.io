Here I want to think about my blogging habit (and habits in general) over the next few months. We will (fingers-crossed) be moving ~across~ up the world and will be many new places without a routine.

The cool part about blogging is that if I manage to survive the chaos of moving while posting every day, then when I settle back down, the habit will pick back up where it left off.

I imaging this transfers to other habits as well and is the power of STREAKS. Momentum is a real (psychological) thing I think so...

Anywho, the preparation is as follows:
1. Draft 7 blogs in the queue by August 12th
1. Program and host a 'backup poster' script running on an "always on" machine.
1. Install GitHub on my phone in case the rioters get inside Amazon and pull all the wires from AWS servers, so I can post from my phone.
