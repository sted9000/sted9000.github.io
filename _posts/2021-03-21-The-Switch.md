Another "don't always be one thing" example today listening to a Jerry Seinfeld podcast again. 

Paraphrasing here: Be gentle and kind to yourself after you write. Don't judge it and don't show it to anyone that same day. You did the work... When you come back to edit it, be a ruthless s.o.b.. Be your harshest critic. 95% of it surely sucks.

He credits much of his success to being able to switch between these two opposite modes. 

I think this approach makes sense for many difficult endeavors. Be extremely kind to yourself (and others) after bringing yourself to do the work. Later, when polishing the work, be exacting and cruel.

Happy Spring Everyone
