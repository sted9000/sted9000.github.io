I push the perspective of “Life is a Game” very often. Hearing plans and problems I change the language to that of a game (excitement, scared, curious rather than obligation and duty) and encourage the childlike mindset of games - games are light and fun; life often carries the connotation of being heavy and burdensome.
While I will still defend this position, recently I have seen it’s limitation and have needed to amend my position to “life is a game except on the extremes”.
Example One – Finances: Think of money as points when you are not needing for the essentials or when you have all the points necessary to irradiate polio.
Maybe this is another example of virtues pushed to extremes becoming vices. Gamify your life, virtue. Completely forget that life is not a game, vice.
