Ten things I love about driving:

1. You can scream at the top of your lungs and no one can hear you.
1. Being in control of a powerful machine.
1. The sight of people sitting on front porches.
1. Excuse for coffee and a donut.
1. Get to spend intimate time with someone.
1. Lots of sunlight.
1. The feeling of moving through space.
1. See loved ones in other states within hours.
1. The smell of gasoline.
1. Uninterrupted daydreaming and brainstorming.
