I sold a good chunk of my Bitcoin today and I want my thinking on the record. 

The primary reason is that I just didn't like how emotionally invested I have become in the everyday movement. It is at an unhealthy point and I want to change. 

The second reason (and the probable driver of the first) is that I don't want much risk at the moment. BTC going to 10k tomorrow would have led to me _working_ sooner than I want. Selling some now eliminates that potential negative outcome.

For many reasons, I am still a big bull, but I am growing skeptical that we are living in a financial bubble. Bubbles pop. How much of the stock market and bitcoins rise over the past year is due to Robinhood speculators and artificial stimulus? I don't know. 

I guess that this time 2022 BTC will be between approaching 100-200k. Perhaps, I will have regret as I do now for missing _the opportunity of a lifetime_ run from $12 to 60k. But it is a certainty that I will be healthier (and hopefully still unemployed) for taking some excitement and money off the table.
