The question my older brother is struggling with: What posture to take to Trumpists? 

My answer is: The posture that destroys the cult and allows for its former members to be reincorporated into the real world.

But that still begs the question: Compassion or scorn, tolerance or confrontation, withdrawal or engagement?

My brother fears that compassion, tolerance, and withdrawal give too much ground for entitlement and lunancy to stand. He thinks that you should drive them to the edge of the cliff with scorn, confrontation, and engagement. 

I will be thinking on this for a bit...
