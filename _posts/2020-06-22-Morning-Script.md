I finally have a working version of a little expressjs app to start my day in front of the screen. I call it morningScript. The hope is that it guides my attention down the right path by setting worries aside, delivering a touch of thoughtfulness by reading my favorite blogs, inspires a little creativity, and finally reminds me of my objectives for the week.
