Yesterday, unwillingly engaged in argument with my partner, I was in need of help, cover, air-support, anything to escape the battle with minimal carnage.

On cue... Enter flyover.

A bird dropped two a-bomb sized loads inches from the target.

The target was not injured (apart from a little shrapnel lodged in the calf), but the message was received. The battle was over.
