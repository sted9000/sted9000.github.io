Confused (adj): Being unable to think with clarity or act with understanding and intelligence.

The whole world seems to be... I don't know...

Normally, I am good at tuning down out the rest of the world. This time I can't and I am not sure if it is just me or if this time really is different.

Errr... Until tomorrow, be well.
