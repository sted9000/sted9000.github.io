I have read my fair share of self-help, pop-psychology, and happiness books. There is something about them I love, but until today I don't think I ever consciously realized what it was. 

First off, these books (podcasts, articles, YouTube videos) are jam-packed with practical ideas. Ideas that you can imagine changing your life, the lives of those around you, and even the world. These ideas are like candy to my mind - I could consume them endlessly as they each are sweet and have a novel flavor.

Secondly, they are inspiring and create a burst of physical and mental energy. And how very wonderful it is to be full of energy. 

However, these qualities that I love about self-help books don't necessarily lead to progress. Worse yet, they can be addicting and disempowering. Self-help doesn't help when you don't integrate the practical ideas into your life. Self-help doesn't help when you would prefer reading another self-help book for the quick hit of motivation rather than struggling through a difficult yet meaningful task. 

To end, a quote from a self-help book: "On one level, wisdom is nothing more than an ability to follow one's own advice."
