Last week my friend and member of the blogging mafia Jonny Spicer posted about [Ice Cream Victories](https://jonnyspicer.com/mendokusai/2020/09/02/ice-cream-victories). He tells the true story of how baffling hard it is to put down the tub after eating any fraction of it.

While the debate between the single-life and the partnered-life will rage on, as it relates to ice cream, I believe the partnered-life wins hands down. Portions are cut in half, guilt is diminished to near zero, satisfaction soars, and the lip-licking goodness remains constant.

Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Fudge (with a partner) for the win.
