The famous yet understated observation that _you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with_ has a different dimension when you are living alone. The 5 people, rather than being your partner, friends, and family, are podcasters and authors.

And it is amazing how quickly you change when these 5 people in your life are swapped. Attitudes, perspectives, habits, and desires can all shift quickly and in substantial ways without much intentional deliberation.

It is, at once, worrying and inspiring to realize this fact.
