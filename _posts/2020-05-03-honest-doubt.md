Recently while an interviewer was drooling over his latest miracle-like accomplishment, my poker idol dropped another subtle yet profound nugget of wisdom directly on my head.

"I believe one of my strengths over my career has been that I have always known how complex the game is and how little I knew."

He didn't expand on this mindset of humility and 'not-knowing'. But during the weeks since the nugget hit me, the bruise has healed and the inner workings of the idea are becoming apparent.

1. Rather than acting as if you knew, honestly stating that you do not know engages the rational part of the brain to search for good answers. This process facilitates learning.

2. An honest account of your knowledge (or lack thereof) is freeing. Rather than suppression of doubt, wearing it on your sleeve engenders a sense of childlike freedom to experiment and the permission to make constructive mistakes. While pretending to know more than you do is tense. Some small voice knows the walls could come caving in at any moment.
