Prediction: Within ten years we will not buy _computers_ anymore. We will be using interfaces like [MightyApp](www.mightyapp.com) that have computing power baked in. It will allow for computationally expensive websites to run smoothly on even the cheapest device. It will mean a more efficient allocation of resources (why have 16 GB of ram when you only use a few 90% of the time?). And it will mean that the computers that we do have in our homes are more about the display, networking, and sensing, rather than computing power.
