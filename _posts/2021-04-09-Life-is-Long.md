_Life is long_ is a piece of advice I heard the other day. It is obviously counter to the common wisdom of _life is short_. What I think is meant by _life is long_ is that if you are not exactly who, where, or with exactly who you want today, don't beat yourself up about it, you'll get there. And also that who you are on the track of becoming is more important than the single mistake that you made today. 

_Life is short_ might spur you to action, but it also places undue exacting pressure on you. 

So, get to work, _life is long_.
