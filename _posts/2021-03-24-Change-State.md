I am developing some new go-to tools:

- Feeling tired in the middle of the day = Take a 45-minute nap.
- Feeling frustrated = 3 sprints up the drive and kettle-bell swings.
- Feeling blue = Jump in the cold lake.
- Too lazy to cook dinner = Sardine and avocado salad with two fried eggs on top.
- Feeling angry = Free-write in journal.

Feeling tired, frustrated, blue, lazy, or angry is part of life. Finding automatic tools to dispense with them is what makes life fun.
