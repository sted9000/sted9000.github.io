It has been a long while, but at 30 years old I am enjoying playgrounds again. Running around without any need to prepare or worry about breaking things. Just have fun. 

A few of the web technologies I have been exploring have playgrounds that allow the curious to explore, test, and play with no setup cost. [TailwindCSS](www.play.taillwindcss.com) has a playground for styling and [NativeScript](https://play.nativescript.org/) has a playground where you can have a native mobile app up on your phone in seconds. 

I am enjoying it.
