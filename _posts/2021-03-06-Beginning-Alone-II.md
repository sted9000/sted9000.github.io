Things change fast.

If you have ever meditated for a bit you can see that thoughts and emotions are very short-lived things when you are paying attention. But in day-to-day life emotions and moods stick around for some time until we resolve them or get tackled by a new one. That is why what happened today was so striking. Yesterday I was filled to the brim with emotion and thoughts of loneliness (my girlfriend and I are taking some time to ourselves). Today the feeling was almost completely gone. Why was this feeling so strong yesterday if it was not around to stay? Is there some evolutionary advantage to this timing? Is this a common phenomenon? How silly and strange.
