Spending a lot of time with others and all-day with myself, I am very aware of human frailty and mediocrity. And that is putting it too kindly -- some of the time we just suck. The high road is available, but we take the low road. Laughter is on the menu but we choose anger. And I could go on...

And this is why the boring truth that _everyone is doing the best they can_ is still more than a bit unsatisfying. While we are doing the best we can, we could be doing a lot better.
