A [new freeroll](https://freerollio.github.io/#0xdb1d5ed65ebde8809fbb4f4a64fd47fb1bae723cf716d17f489c1738b9e96a6d) has been issued.

I am trying to build a habit of starting my poker playing earlier in afternoon (so I can play more hours). I am a lazy lazy man and am always finding excuses not to start on time (or at all), so I think a freeroll is in order to help me build this habit. My buddy Andy has never seemed to have a problem _putting in the hours_ so I will gift this freeroll to him in hopes of channeling a bit of his energy (and run good).

The details are as follows:
- During the week of June 21 - 27 I must start my poker session at or before 2pm (local time) five or more times.
- I don't trust myself to be 100% honest here so **I must include receipts** (they will be posted here).
- Failure will result in .75ETH be transferred

Good Luck Us.
