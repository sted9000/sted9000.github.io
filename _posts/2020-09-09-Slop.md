Recently, I have been experiencing a slew of 'firsts' coupled with a few 'start-overs'. So far the pleasure has been in not only applying new wisdom (what didn't work last time) to the 'start-overs' but trying to figure out what wisdom or mental models I should be applying to the 'firsts'.

My world is pure slop, chaos, and randomness. Bringing even the slightest bit grace, order, and control to bare is what brings me joy today.
