My girlfriend and are night and day in most regards. This fact proves difficult at times and entertaining at others. Today, however, I spotted a bit of myself in her and it was quite charming.

She bought her first domain name to host [her professional-bio webpage](http://ninni.earth). And as a childlike grin and pleasure radiated out from her I realized that we both love hacking away at building silly things. 

It is not the most profound point of connection, but we both understand this silly part of the other. That is nice.
