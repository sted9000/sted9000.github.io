Most people don't understand what machine learning means (I was one of them until recently). The easiest way to understand it is that rather than teaching a computer to do something by giving it rules, you teach it by giving it examples. 

Understanding machine learning this way allows you to see how it could be much better at many things than a traditional program. For example, what rules would you teach a program to distinguish pictures of cats from dogs? While not impossible to come up with them, it is very very hard. With machine learning, the computer can learn by looking at pictures of cats and dogs. 

I'm one week into the Fast.ai course and loving the teacher and the material. For the first time, the technical and coding knowledge seem accessible to apes like myself. And the possibilities of usefulness seem vast.
