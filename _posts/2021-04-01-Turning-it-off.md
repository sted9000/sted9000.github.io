_Turning it off_ has been a struggle for me -- especially being alone for the last few weeks. Here are some strategies I have been testing out to help:

- Don't turn on the computer before 9 am
- Closing all the work projects on the desktop around 8 pm
- Making a recap of the day and a todo list for tomorrow before signing off
- Being around family at night
