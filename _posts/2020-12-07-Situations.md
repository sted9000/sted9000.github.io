Most of the way through my first ever Holocaust book, I am wondering how I would have faired in such conditions? The account I am reading tells a story filled with psychology so divorced from my own, that I believe the only honest answer is _I don't know_. 

> No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simply to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand. - Victor Frank

And I will never know how I would have fared. I can only be thankful that I don't have to find out. And I can try to answer the problems, albeit simpler ones, that life hands me.
