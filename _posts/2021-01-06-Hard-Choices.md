> Hard Choices, Easy Life. Easy Choices, Hard Life.

Word-for-word the quote above might amount to the densest wisdom of all time and seems fitting for today. Today my immediate family is on the brink of splintering -- heading towards a future where "when is the last time you talked to Mom and Dad?", "how come we don't see Grandpa Joel and Grandma Kris?", and "I haven't been to the lake in years" would be perfectly ordinary sentences. And today the US Capital was stormed by a herd of deeply confused cult members. 

Life is hard because too many easy choices were made.

Too many politicians chose to stick with Trump for too long because it was easy. And too many things went unsaid in our family because it was the easy thing to do. 

So, here is to hard choices and an easy life. Good luck us.
