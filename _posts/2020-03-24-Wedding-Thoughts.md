Previously when asked about my future and imaginative wedding I had no opinions. While I would still happily defer any preferences to my partner, now I do have some strong opinions.

Why the change? Because a good wedding is just fucking great.

It's a celebration of the best kind - a commitment. It's tasty food. It's a coming together of the normally segregated people of our lives. Live entertainment (guitar player, dancers, songs, a band)! Letting loose, smiling, laughing, and dancing. Reminiscing about the past that has brought all these great people together. A marvelous party.
