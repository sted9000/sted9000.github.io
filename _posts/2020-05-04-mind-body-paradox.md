I love a good paradox. Here is Buddhist or eastern style one, if you will.

The mind and body are one, yet consciousness is untethered and free.

Here is my answer:

The mind and the body are one-in-the-same in the traditional way we think about them. Diet and exercise influence mood and alertness. Mood and alertness influence diet and exercise. It works in both directions. Most of the time we would be better off thinking about the mind-body rather than a separate mind carried around in a body. Paul Bloom says "our intuitions about the mind and body are duelist"; I agree and claim this intuition is wrong.

Yet on a more fundamental level, consciousness is divorceable from the body. There is (and this comes directly from Buddhism) an enduring and unchanging quality of the mind beneath both mental and physical states. Something that simply can be aware of both tiredness, dullness, or any other state of mind.

I am fully aware of how hokey and mystical this sounds. But I believe it to be true on evidence (subjective), so fuck off. Paradox solved.
