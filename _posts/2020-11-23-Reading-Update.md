A freeroll update: [Reading six non-fiction books before the end of 2020](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/06/08/reading-freeroll).

- While I only have one down, I am reading a few hours a day now and will be able to finish if I continue at this pace.
-The purpose of the bet was to _become a reader_. I have failed at that, but I can simply start again -- now. 
- A great book and a cup of tea after dinner is just wonderful.
- The remaining books are short ones :)
