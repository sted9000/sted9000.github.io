Another reason I am looking forward to calling one city home for the next five years or so is that I can permit myself to have and fill a bookshelf.

While I am aware that a lot of bookshelves and talking about books is little more than social signaling, I am nonetheless thrilled that I will be sharing my living room with physical books. Some I have read, some were gifts, some I plan on reading, and some I will likely never read but that I just like the idea of.
