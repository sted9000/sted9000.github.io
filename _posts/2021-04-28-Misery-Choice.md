Here is an idea that I am trying on:

> Choosing to not be miserable is what it means to be an adult. Two ways to think about it:

1. Mindfulness / Buddhist approach. If you are miserable it is because you are lost in thought. Snap out of it see the misery as a sensation in your body and choose to do something constructive, positive, meaningful, or god-forbid, fun.
2. If being miserable is not a choice, that means that we are puppets on strings. It is one or the other, right? And while cosmically, nuerophisiologically, and statistically we may be puppets, psychologically it is not a healthy belief. The feeling of not having control over your well-being is evily one of the worst things for your well-being. 

I am not sure if this is going to be helpful, misses the point, or is just the rambling of a mad 31 year old ape.
