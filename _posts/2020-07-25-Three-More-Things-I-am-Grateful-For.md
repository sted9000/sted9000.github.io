The brain is not had has not been functioning properly today. So gratitude journal it is.

1. My kindle. I would like to say that I would choose my kindle over my phone, but how much of that is social signaling and how much is true is debatable. Either way, the kindle is great and I plan on keeping mine for many years to come.
1. The back button on the mouse. Programming more and more now, I am trying to use the mouse less and less. However, when online, the mouse back button is a real god-send.
1. Doctors who are good with old people. When your body is falling apart and you are losing your mind you don't want a doctor who is a nerd, a dick, or incompetent. You want personable, humane, and competent doctor. Fortunately, they seem to be many. Thank you.
