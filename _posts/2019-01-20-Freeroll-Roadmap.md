#### General
My vision is a little fuzzy on where I want to take [freeroll.io](https://freeroll.io).
He the idea is to critically think and outline the path forward.

#### Mission
Create a tool that is helpful and adds value while developing fundamental programming skills.

#### Roadmap
1. Bug test and fix UI to a point where I am very proud of it.
2. Optimize solidity contract code for cost and usability.
3. Extensively test security.
4. Get users who find it valuable (goal: > 10 weekly active users).
5. Gather feedback.

#### Timeline
1. Mid Feb 2019
2. Early March 2019
3. End March 2019
4. End April 2019
5. End May 2019
