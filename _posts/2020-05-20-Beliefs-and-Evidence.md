I came across a good mental model yesterday regarding belief and incorporating new evidence.

When we are presented evidence that supports our current beliefs we ask the question "can I believe this?". When we are presented evidence that contradicts our current beliefs we ask another "do I have to believe this?". 

In a world overflowing with evidence of all sorts, there is much that we can believe, but very little that we need to.

I think this model explains a lot of what is going on right now politically.
