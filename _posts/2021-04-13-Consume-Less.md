One of the biggest skills I have sharpened lately in my classes with my coding mentor is laying bare my lack of knowledge or understanding.

Saying "Let me interrupt you. You lost me at ..." or "Sorry, I don't know what you mean by ..." is always uncomfortable and it is a valuable skill. The more I am honest and vocal about what I understand and what I don't the more I learn, the more satisfied I am after the class, and the more I feel the teacher enjoys the class because they can sense that I have learned something. 

It is always tempting to nod my head and pretend I understand more than I do. And it is always worth resisting.
