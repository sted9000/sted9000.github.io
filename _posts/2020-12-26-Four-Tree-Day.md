Forest is my new favorite app because it gives me a new metric to measure my day: How many trees did I plant today. The app is simple:
1. You set a timer
1. While the timer is running, a tree grows
1. If you focus for the duration of the timer you are rewarded with the full-grown tree in your forest (else the tree dies).

A Pomodoro timer, but gamified and green. Helping me stay focused and building a undistractable mind.
