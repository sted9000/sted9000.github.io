Listening to someone who believes in aliens my urge is to change there mind and my frustration is that I don't have the skills to do so.

It is bugging me... so my mind has come up with an approach to rectify the situation.

The _alien believer_ values dearly their own open mindedness and skepticism. From the little I know, the scientific process is the best game in town for open minded skeptics. Nothing is claimed to be proven absolutely and every finding can be undermined or expanded upon.

We will start here, and report back...
