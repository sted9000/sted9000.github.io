Idea: Constantly interacting with a lot of people is a double-edged sword.

On the one hand, it is very rewarding and insightful. On the other, it is distracting and chaotic. 

I love one of Kevin Kelly's lines that goes something like: I learn by talking to people, I think by writing, and I communicate to make a living. 

He is correct. Talking to people is a wonderful way to learn. The past few weeks I have been talking to programmers, friends, family, counselors, business partners, and sales reps... I learned a ton. 

But now I am tired, I don't feel like I have gotten much meaningful work done, and I need to clarify all the insight that so many great human interactions hurled at me. 

Much like a drug, sugar, alcohol, or tech-detox, I plan on taking a human interaction detox here soon.
