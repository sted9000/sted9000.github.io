So the verdict has come down: Side Hustles are not good.

If you are spending time and energy to make income outside of your profession or career you are doing it wrong.

This is obvious. The part that was missing in my mind was more specific (and proper) definition of a side hustle.

Taking a course for continuing education, learning to code, or playing chess on the weekends is no a side hustle.

Creating a blog to potentially, maybe, one day, get new clients is a side hustle.

The logic is that if you have time and energy to hustle on the side you should do one of two things:

1. Put that time and energy in to your main hustle.
1. Make the side hustle your main hustle.

The fear is that side hustles are too often and too easily a distraction from real and meaningful and thoughtful work.

Resistance.
