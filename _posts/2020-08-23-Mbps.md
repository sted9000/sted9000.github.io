What a silly world. This weekend was great. Relaxing, reconnecting with my family, food, fun, and sun. Upon returning to my normal life of setting up a move to another city. I realize that our new apartment only has access to DSL internet (5-15Mbps - slow). My whole world is in flames.

Until tomorrow, be well.
