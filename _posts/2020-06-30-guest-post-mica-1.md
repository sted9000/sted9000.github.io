Today I have a guest post from The Lonely Assistant! She blogs at [addhana](http://addhana.wordpress.com/) and is very cute when she writes - she laughs, whispers to herself, and smiles her beautiful smile.

Yesterday I (finally) graduated from college. After years of hard work with countless hours with my but in the chairs and my nose between textbooks I made it over 5 years of intense work where summarized in a 40-minute presentation.

Many of my close friends gathered to see the whole thing unfold in youtube, and reading their comments and feeling their virtual presence had a nice comforting sensation in a time where the sense of isolation is the new norm.

My love-hate relationship with social media is well known, and I was a little reticent at first to post on Instagram about it. But thank god I did, I received so many messages from people that were part of my life at different stages. I took the time to answer every single one of them, and try to figure out what they are doing, how they are handling, and struggling with the growing pains.

The degree is awesome (and I'm happy with the achievement) but it's true what they say, everything is ten times better when shared.
