I'm interested in communication and curious as to what Communications Departments at Universities teach. If it is anything that could give me some insight into the experience I had this morning, I might be sneaking into some Penn classes over the next four years.

We after returning from my morning walk, I recruited Mica to help retrieve a dresser that I spotted on the street up for donation. A mini-morning adventure. One block away we encountered 3 females and a dolly with the dresser. They scooped us.

I had the urge to say something playful to them as we crossed paths. "We were just on our way to pick that up..." I said as my opener. The sentiment was received all wrong - as if I were implying that we should be entitled to the dresser. All I wanted to convey was a funny little anecdote and to make them feel good about being so quick.

"I'm sorry. You saw it first. You can have it if you want it", one girl responded.

I imagine there is a different tone or phase I could have used in that moment to convey what I wanted much better.

Communication... Dooooo
