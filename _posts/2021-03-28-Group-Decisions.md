One of the many lessons I learned in 2020 is that not every decision should be left to the individual. What happened was each family member decided how to go about life in covid-land and then getting together was too dramatic. Feelings got hurt and relationships were battered.

We should have realized that it was a group decision, not an individual one. 95% of drama would have been avoided. 

I am sure that this category of decision will come up again in the future. Hopefully, my radar will be tuned to pick it up. Furthermore, I hope everyone will be able to see that while power by default should lie with the individual, there are exceptions.
