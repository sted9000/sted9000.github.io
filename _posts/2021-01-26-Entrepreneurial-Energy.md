For the first time in a long time, I feel 'entrepreneurial energy.' Like a child diligently setting up a lemonade stand, nothing besides cars/hour calculations and the cost of lemons and sugar will cross his mind for hours on end. And those hours FLY by.

It is a wonderful and overlooked pleasure to have abundant energy for life -- even if it is born of illusions of gradure.
