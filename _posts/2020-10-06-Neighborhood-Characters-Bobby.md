Moving to a brand new city during the pandemic has limited the social connections that I was hoping to build upon arrival. The smallest things like knocking on a neighbors door to introduce yourself seem to be taboo - rightly or wrongly.

Bobby - a wiry-looking black man who walks his jack-rustle every morning and is always up for a chat - is the closet thing I get to an impromptu human connection every day. He is a strange and cool guy. Strange because of how overtly proud he is of his dog's behavior (this made more sense when I found out he is an ex-military drill sergeant). And cool because he is one of those people who never lack for enthusiasm. When walking away you take a much-needed deep breath and then wonder how anyone can have such energy.

I am looking forward to many more strange and cool encounters on the streets in the years to come.
