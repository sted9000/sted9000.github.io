Memorable Ideas:

- The benefit of having a group around him that was also searching for spiritual development... Community.

- The stark difference between theory and practice. Between knowledge and direct knowledge.

- Lack of personality somehow equates to charisma.

- Have no idols. Have a Dharma.

- Meditative skills don't directly equate to ethics.

- The middle path. Between indulgence and asceticism.

- To reject dogma without rejecting those who embrace dogmas. A new onboard-speech to the Dharma for each unique student.

Best line:
> [Don't worship me when I am dead. Just] remember me as one who has woken up.
