Still having to write my 30th Birthday Year in Review post, I find myself immensely enjoying being 30. I have a three-part hypothesis as to why.

1. When 30 you image you have learned a lot of important stuff in your twenties that will serve you well for the duration.

2. You also start to see the duration as finite. In your twenties you were infinite. In your thirties even though the end of the line seems a far way off, you are now aware that the train does have a terminal stop.

3. You can imagine accomplishing most, if not all, that you want to in the time remaining. Projects take years, careers take decades, meaningful relationships span half-centuries. But all those fit comfortably in the 60 years to come.

One of the few books my father nudged me to read was titled "The Defining Decade" and was about the importance of your twenties. What might you title your book about your Thirties?
