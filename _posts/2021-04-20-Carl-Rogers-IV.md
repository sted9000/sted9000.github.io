Learning #4 from Carl Rogers

> Evaluation by others is not a guide for me. 

Well, duh. 

But Rogers then goes out of his way to say that collecting evidence about your endeavors (both positive and negative) are to be taken into account. But...

> ...to weigh this evidence and to determine its meaning and usefulness is a task I cannot relinquish to anyone else. 

To be honest, I don't think I have learned this fully. By outside measures, I am a non-conformist who guides himself. But internally I still have many aim-to-please instincts. 

Surely the saying _don't care what others think_ is not entirely correct because others' judgments do hold some value. Perhaps _care only about what others think about and which you care about_ is a better way to think about it (but it doesn't roll off the tongue).
