The project I am working on is at a point where some seemingly crucial decisions are going to be made. Talking about this with a friend, he reminded me of the concept _one-way and two-way doors_, which has helped ease my mind. 

One-way doors are irreversible decisions, while two-way doors are reversible. At this point in my project, the distinction between decisions might help me move forward faster and smarter -- spending much more time on one-way door decisions and more rapidly making two-way door decisions. 

Tomorrow I want to clarify what are the tells or give-aways that a decision is a one-way door. Are they obvious? Are they knowable in advance? What are some examples from other start-ups?
