At ten years old I was always thrilled when I found money on the ground. It was a bonus. "It's my lucky day", I would say".

Passing an unclaimed $1 note on our walk this morning, my girlfriend asked "should I pick it up?". "No", I replied.

As we began walking again I was disheartened. What kind of world do we live in that something as innocent and joyous as picking up a $1 bill is now uncertain and scary?

Has the world changed that much? Have I?
