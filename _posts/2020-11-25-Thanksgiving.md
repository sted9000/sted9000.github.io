At the dinner table tonight, my mother and I bemoaned 2020 and offered solace to each other that "it's almost over." But then we stopped and counted our blessings. The list of things to be thankful for this year was longer than I realized:
- We were able to move to back to the US
- Mica got into a great school 
- My brother got engaged
- My sister is getting married
- My brother bought a house
- Poker games were good during quarantine
- My grandfather moved to our hometown
- My brother had a healthy baby
- Business was good for my parents

Setting covid aside, we have a lot to give thanks for tomorrow while we feast.
