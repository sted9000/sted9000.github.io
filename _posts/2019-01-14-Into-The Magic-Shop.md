[Into The Magic Shop](https://www.amazon.com/Into-Magic-Shop-Neurosurgeons-Mysteries/dp/0399183647/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1547478936&sr=8-1&keywords=into+the+magic+shop+by+james+doty) was a Christmas gift from my aunt and uncle. While most books given and received in my house are never read, I actually started this one<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> and didn't stop until the back cover.

One sentence review: A fast and inspiring introduction to a secular spiritual life told through a personal narrative with many messages to take away.

My thoughts: I really enjoyed it (thanks Aunt Kim). It was the perfect book to read while taking care of your old stubborn, angry, dying grandfather. The author uses minimal woo-woo when telling his journey, which I appreciated. If I ever have half as much to write about and can do it half as well as he did I will be thrilled.

Quotes and Ideas:

- Meditation might be a great tool to teach to kids.

- "...who knew the cost of everything and the value of nothing." - Oscar Wilde

- "They [mindfulness techniques] can increase focus and help us make decisions more quickly, but without wisdom and insight (opening the heart) the techniques can result in self-absorption, narcissism, and isolation. Our journey isn't meant to be an inward journey alone, but an outward journey of connection as well."

- "...what was it about Ruth's teachings that seemed so compelling and I realized that at their core they were about opening the heart. Acting kindly and compassionately with intent."

- "What you think you want is not always what's best."

- "...compassion is an instinct, perhaps our most innate."

- "The magic also gave me the courage to take risks and feel secure that, regardless of the outcome, I would be OK."

- "We are at the beginning of an age of compassion."

- The Alphabet of the Heart: CDEFGHIJKL. Compassion, Dignity, Forgiveness, Gratitude, Humility, Integrity, Justice, Kindness, Love.

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: This is the first time a am fairly confident that blurbs got me to read a book.
