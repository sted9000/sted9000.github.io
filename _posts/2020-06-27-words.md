I am a big fan of words. Books, YouTube videos, songs lyrics, conversations, jokes, journaling, I like them all. That said, in the ideal world that lives in my imagination, there are 90 percent fewer words. Of the 90 percent, most will come from idle speech, journalism, and Facebook. All books and conversations can remain.

Or perhaps 99 percent of verbal communication could go and we keep only the essential 1 percent, all non-verbal communication, and the written word.

Not surprisingly, I am having trouble putting this feeling of the problem with words into words. "They just get in the way of life" is the best I can put it. They are most often unneeded and unskillful. They harden our egos and sense of self. When we talk too much, we are tricked into believing that words - and their children: ideas and thoughts - are essential components of reality itself. When we don't talk, we are reminded that reality exists before words and that it is clouded by them.
