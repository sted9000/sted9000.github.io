Not by any means philosophical in the traditional sense, my father does consistently bring to bear one presupposition on the philosophy of life - no regrets.

I very much like this lens to view decisions through - "act in a way that will leave you with no regrets". But I am coming to see it as a very tricky lens. The 'experiencing self' and the 'remembering self' both look through this same lens and yet see wholly different landscapes.

I don't know what I am getting at here, but the feeling coming from regretting not ordering dessert last night and the one coming when you are 80 from not doing enough in a time of crisis seem so dispirit as to not be describing the same thing.
