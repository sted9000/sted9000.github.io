Freeroll #4 for 2021 is going to be my final offering for the moment. If the habits needed to accomplish them come easy, then perhaps I will add a few more. The first three have been _things to do_ and this last one will be _things to remove_. Enough preamble... My internet usage must be less than 1% for each of the following sites: Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and GoogleNews. The one caveat is that I can watch YouTube when I am on the stationary bike. 

My internet usage is captured by an extention, so measuring will be no problem. The freeroll is from Jan 25th - Dec 31st 2021. Good luck us.

Tomorrow I will be handing out the four freerolls along with the promise of 1ETH if I fail.
