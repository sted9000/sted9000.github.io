Something that I want to keep an eye on is what I am calling "two-way-streets".

Two examples:

Yesterday I heard best-selling author Michael Lewis talk about how he is a naturally happy person and has "trained" his friends around the theme of complaining. He does not allow them to complain to him and he doesn't complain to them [about unimportant things]. His natural happiness leads towards less petty conversations (one way) and less petty conversations lead towards more happiness (the other way).

James Clear of Atomic Habits hypothesized another example. We form habits based on our identity (one way) and our habits shape our identity (the other way).

Although I am not yet sure what the underlying relationship of these examples are trying to point out. Nor if "two-way-street" is a good name for them. I feel like there is something here worth exploring here. Something that could bring more peace of mind and less contradicting myself.
