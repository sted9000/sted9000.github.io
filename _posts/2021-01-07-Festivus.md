is the made-up holiday from Seinfeld where tradition demands "the airing of grievances". I am convinced that my family needs a Festivus holiday. It only needs to be one day of the year. The rest of the year we can mind our own business. But the valve of opinion, self-righteousness, and judgment needs to be opened every once in a while. 

It is good for the sake of sanity.

It is good for developing thick skin.

It is good for the honest feedback from those who know you well. 

It is good for a laugh (at a future date).

It is good because it is a reminder that those who judge you so harshly are often those who care for you most. 

I'm going to make this happen. A [festivus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX55AzGku5Y) for the rest of us.
