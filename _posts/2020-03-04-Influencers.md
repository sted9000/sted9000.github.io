The term _influencer_ always leaves my mouth as a four-letter-word, but I am starting to think that I am wrong in my condemnation. The truth is that I am actively looking for more and better _influencers_ in my life, as I think they are extremely valuable.

Cynically, they are sales-men in disguise, selling you under false or shallow pretenses.

But on the other hand, it is inevitable that we are influenced by those around us (we compare, judge, and envy). So why not choose our _influencers_.

I suppose the idea is: choose _influencers_! But carefully and consciously.
