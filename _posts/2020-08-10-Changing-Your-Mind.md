A few interesting points from Marc Andreessen on changing your mind:

1. It is rare for people to do it.
1. Why are people as averse to it? It is almost as they treat ideas and beliefs as they do children.
1. The people who do change their minds are those you have incentives to do so. A prime example is hedge fund managers. They can change their mind and directly profit from it.
 
My thought is that if people need incentives to change their minds, we can give them that incentive through culture. Dis your friend by telling him that you knew that he wouldn't change his mind. Complement your mom on a slight change in her thinking. And rather than bash yourself for being stupid or naive, celebrate when you are reasoned out of an idea.
