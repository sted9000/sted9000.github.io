Have I mentioned **A great podcast** - [The Science of Happiness](https://samharris.org/podcasts/196-science-happiness/).

A cool tool brought to you by the coolest of all tools - our minds. And it involves time travel!

You can positively impact the disposition of your future self by imagining how your way-in-the-future-self will reflect on an event. Confused? Here is an example:

Before an interview you are nervous. Tool: Think about how your future self will reflect on the interview. "Tough questions, I like answering tough questions, they make me think". Then during the interview when you get asked a tough question you can not panic and have a moment of relaxation or joy because your frame for this situation has been positively imagined.

That is cool. I can use to help put in the hours at work. Imagine my future self being proud and satisfied at the end of a long day's work :)
