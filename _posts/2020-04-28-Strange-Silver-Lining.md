A strange _silver lining_ to the COVID19 world that we find ourselves in is that we are going to experience years or decades worth of change in months. Scott Galloway says _COVID19 is not so much an agent of change as it is an accelerant of change_. What would have happened in 2025 with regards to retail is going to happen in October 2020.

The transition time is getting cut down to near zero. Teachers don't have years to learn how to effectively teach online, they have days.

Money and power is shifting faster than ever as well. Bailouts, market volatility, 10+% unemployment, immigration restrictions all are huge and largely new things with wholly unknown outcomes.

This is not a time to have your head in the sand. Although it is impossible to catch all of the lightning fast changes occurring, if you don't try, tomorrow you might wake up in a strange new world.
