An opinion that I want to stop being frightened to hold or embrace:

> Thinking about death often is necessary for a good life.

I have heard no good rebuttal to this claim, yet I feel uncomfortable embracing the opinion because of the stigma surrounding it. 

It is reality, perspective, and motivation in one pill. Why wait until death is knocking at the door to benefit from this fact of life.
