Getting a COVID test yesterday, surprisingly, was the highlight of my day. We have been stripped of the small human interactions lately, and frankly, I didn't appreciate how much I was missing them. 

The testing center was in the hood (the two most happening places on the block were the funeral home and the community COVID testing center), walking there at 3 pm ruined my productive day, and I had to wait forty-five minutes. But in the end, the pleasures of the small human interactions were worth it. 

A shared smile with a child, the touch of the nurse, sharing glances with strangers, a thirty-second chat with the receptionist, and a "thank you" served, ironically, as a respite from the isolation of lock-down.
