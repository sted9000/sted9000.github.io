Three mistakes (learnings) from building my first prototype mobile app:

1. I built an actual app. Not a good idea for getting it into the hands of pilot testers. Two options would almost always be better: a) A PWA if you want to make it interactive; b) A simple click-through model that conveys the idea of the app.
1. I spent a month too long making it. Mistake #1 contributed to the excess time it took to build. But also I was too focused on things that I should not have been focused on -- such as UI.
1. Most of the code has zero chance of being reused after the prototype. I imaging this is often the case, but it would be nice to have done it in a way where there was at least a possibility to keep or reuse some of it. 

I rushed into it because I was excited. I should have done a full day's research and talk to someone with experience... I learned the hard way when I should have learned the easy way.
