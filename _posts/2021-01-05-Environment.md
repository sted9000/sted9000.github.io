> Children are shaped by their environment, adults shape their environment. 

This quote strikes home.

The older I become, the more influence I attribute to the environment -- and less to the agent. That said,  I have not fully accepted the responsibility stemming from this belief.

I should stop getting frustrated when I fail due to not shaping my environment correctly. Rather, I should tap myself on the head and tell myself that "I know what's going on here."
