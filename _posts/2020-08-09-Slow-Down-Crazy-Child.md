One parallel between poker and life is the ability and necessity to slow down when at specific moments.

An important decision that needs to be made NOW ("Only two airline tickets remain, but we haven't secured our visa yet. What do we do?") triggers both a focusing of attention and a heightened level of energy. Attention and energy are both good. However, there also comes a desire to act immediately impulsively. This is not good, as these moments are often the time for slow, deliberate, and dispassionate reasoning.

In every poker session you ever play, there is at least one spot that is important and affects our biology and psychology the same was an important real-life decision would - our attention narrows, our heart beats faster, and impulse is the desired solution. As a poker player, you handle the situation methodically by hitting your time-bank, taking a breath, listening to (but not acting upon) your impulse, and then, finally by thinking slowly. The clearer, more dispassionate, considered, and informed your thinking is, the more you will win.
