The extra time a lot of us have and being a bit under the weather has permitted my focus to wonder and try a few new things over the past few days. One cool tool that I am loving is [Brave](https://brave.com). It is the internet browser I would have built if I could build a browser.

A few cool features to convince you to give it a try:

1. It has privacy measures built in to the browser. No need to worry about add-on or extensions. No cross-site cookies and https enforcement, and other privacy and security features that are above my pay-grade.

2. A new model for the relationship between advertisers and consumers. Opt-in or out of seeing _privacy respecting ads_ and get paid for seeing them!

3. A new model for content producers and consumers. Easily tip or regularly contribute directly to your favorite content producer right from the browser.

4. Very similar to chrome (think it uses the open-source version of chrome) and therefore allows you to access the big library of chrome extensions / plug-ins.

5. Cryptocurrency features built into the browser. Web3.0!

6. Simple setup

7. Fast. Supposedly this is because you don't have as many trackers following you around.

Highly recommended. A cool tool.
