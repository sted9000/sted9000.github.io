> But, like most human beings, people in the financial industry are better at rationalizing than at being rational. - The Devil's Financial Dictionary

Recently I have been around people who fit this description well -- very good rationalizers. Their rationalizing is obvious.

I know I am guilty too. Pushed and pulled along by pure desire, only to rationalize later. 

I now strongly believe that to become more rational (a noble goal) you should not try to be more rational. Trying to be more rational largely leads only to more rationalizing. A far better strategy is to simply try to see rationalizing more clearly. 

Counterintuitively this means less thinking, not more, is the path to acting rationally.
