One thing that stuck out to me in Maya Angelou's _Letter to My Daughter_ was the frequency of mentions and the reverence she shows to the virtue of courage. 

It is not a term that I hear a lot in 2020. It sounds a bit dramatic, a bit dated, and a bit fantastical. So when I thought, "how can I be a bit more courageous?" I came up with diddly squat. But Angelou steered me in the right direction with: 

> Courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage. - Maya Angelou

In this light, I see how important, and non-dramatic, courage is. It is not so much good in-and-of-itself, but rather as a necessity for a virtuous life. How many of the things that I should do but don't are for no other reason than a lack of courage?
