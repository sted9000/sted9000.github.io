One of the things I am trying to embrace more as an aspiring developer is the following reality: At my fingertips is _an answer_ to my problem. Always. 

And when this is the case, frustration does not make sense. Ever.

Even cooler than there always being an answer, is that it brings the opportunity to learn. 100 times a day you have the choice to be frustrated -> or to be patient -> delighted.
