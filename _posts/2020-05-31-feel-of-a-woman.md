I assume based upon my internet history that I am unemployable. If some high-risk employer would still take a chance on me, today's short post will probably dissuade him for fear of scorn from legal or HR.

Being single most of my life, one of the main things I craved was not sex, companionship, or the common commodities of a relationship. My lust was for the touch and feel of a woman - my hand on her skin. Simple physical contact and the subtle orchestra of emotions that accompany it.

What a wonderful feeling.
