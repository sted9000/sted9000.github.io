New Toy Review: Apple Watch Series 3 (aka the cheap one)

Building my morning habit routine and pulling out my phone to time my walks, workouts, and smoothy making was becoming a bit cumbersome. Running holding my phone in the cold weather (so I could track my runs) was not very much fun. So I set out looking for a smartwatch.

After wearing a trial Apple Watch Series 4 for a few days I was sold. But seeing that I like small watch-faces, don't need much functionality, and would rather not spend $350+ for a Series 6, the 38mm Series 3 was the obvious choice at half the price.

I love it:
- The band is very easy to remove and put on and stays on securely during workouts and runs.
- The alarm is gentle and does not wake up my partner!
- Waterproof
- I love how small it and plain-looking it is.
- It takes only two taps to track any exercise.
- It is very programable. Can turn off notifications and have a ton of useful information right on the home screen.
