> I admire people who can turn it on and turn it off. Be a gentle spirit with most, but stand firm whenever necessary. Don't take yourself so seriously most days, but turn into a straight killer when the game begins. Etc. Being one thing all the time is suboptimal.

This comes from my favorite Twitter follow, James Clear, and is something I thought a lot about in my attempt to be more assertive.

I feared that in becoming more assertive I would shed my _gentle spirit_. So, I reformulated the goal from "be more assertive" to "know when to be more assertive and be so". This allowed me to hang on to my gentle disposition as well as stand up when necessary.

And while I am writing in the past tense, it is still very much a work in progress.

...

As a side note, I am finding joy in a new place: When I ask myself "Is this a time to be more assertive?" and the answer is no, I smile because my disposition is aligned with what I believe to be right.
