Watching the aftermath of the election will be interesting on many fronts. However, I am most interested in the model/prediction/betting discussion sure to ensue.

Were the polls systematically off? Did the models account for enough uncertainty? Were the betting markets more knowledgeable than the models?

Given that this was a one-off event, these are impossible questions to answer. But the discussion surrounding them should be lively nonetheless. 

My initial inclinations are that the models performed relatively well (given Trump way out-performed the polls and Biden still won), but that some evidence of systemic biases in polling will be found and need to be tweaked.
