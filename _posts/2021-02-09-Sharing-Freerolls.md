> No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it. - Seneca

I think this is another case for freerolls. When you make a freeroll, you are looking to do or obtain something good. Why not share it with a friend. And I think that is a good way to make a freeroll -- ask _who is this best shared with?_ The answer could come from many directions: the person who will hold you most accountable, the person you want to inspire, the person you want to bond over the subject matter with, the person you want to prove yourself to, or the person who inspires you. 

If you couldn't tell, I am still hooked on the power of freerolls. In the world of abundance that we are finding ourselves in, the risk of loss, the thrill of victory, and the pleasantness of sharing it all with a friend are going to make freerolls _a thing._
