Some inspiration doesn't hit you the very moment you encounter it.

The movie Ford v Ferrari has a scene where laying on the track the protagonist and his son ponder the perfect race lap. They conclude that it's possible and that "it's out there".

The moment in the movie didn't call my attention. But today while playing, the thought of the perfect poker session crossed my mind and has me motivated to chase it.

"It's out there".

(I proceeded to lose a lot and got frustrated.)
