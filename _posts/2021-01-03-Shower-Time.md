Convincing my grandfather into taking his first shower in the last 365 days was a lesson in patience, persistence, and persuasion. He was scared and embarrassed. My brother-in-law, my sister, and I sat with him chatting and watching football for an hour while. But what we were actually doing was reminding him we love him, building him up, lightening his mood, and giving him reasons why he should take a shower. Towards the end, I saw my opportunity and went and turned on the water in the shower and gave my final and quite elegant (if I do say so myself) speech. 

He resigned himself to the shower. Victory.
