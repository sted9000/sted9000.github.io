My friend [Jonny](www.jonnyspicer.com) and I agreed to start a joint series where we will debate the issues surrounding race and equality. I was half excited and half dreading the exercise. Excited to engage intellectually in a new way. Deading it because it was going to be a lot of energy and attention spent on something that I saw little practical value in engaging with... until today. 

Now I clearly see the power these issues have to invade people's lives. Kind and compassionate people are being duped into anger and tribalism. Rather than dreading the exercise, I now am angry and looking forward to it. Falsehoods are being served up and it is affecting people I care about. 

That said, I hope to use this anger only as fuel to understand the topic and not let it close my mind or prevent a constructive conversation. If it turns out that I happen to be standing in the wrong place, great. My ego will be butt-hurt, but standing in truth will have been worth the price. If it turns out that I am correct, I hope then to be able to articulate myself in a way that is helpful to others.
