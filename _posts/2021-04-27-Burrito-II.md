Yesterday was the first day on the burrito journey. What I learned was that chipotle size is perfect and I love their tortilla and the foil wrapping for the deliver mechanism. Things that could be improved was the quaility of the wrapping I had to spend much time and energy unwrapping the thing. Wrapping method will be important I think. As for taste and quality, it is really good, but not great. Another thing to improve on is the _mixing_ if the ingrediants are not mixed then you have a good chance of biting into a bit that only has one ingrediant and I don't think that is optimal (although variation is a good thing at times). So perhaps a _light mixing_ is in order for the optimal burrito.
