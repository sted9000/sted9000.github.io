A lot of very fuzzy ideas rattling around in my head. None of which feel even half-baked or blog-worthy.

List of Ten:

1. Any difference between momentum and inertia (psychologically speaking).
1. The disturbing type of freedom stemming from being untethered from a community or path.
1. Daily rituals and routines. How simple and boring inputs seem to translate into expanding and interesting outputs.
1. Much of the time when I say "I couldn't care less", it means something else.
1. Side Hustles. Are they a good idea or a massive waste of time?
1. What in the world happened to Jordan Peterson?
1. The new go-to breakfast: Three fried eggs (in coconut oil, crispy on the bottom, yokes still runny) with a bit of sriracha and sea salt.
1. Should you choose the books you read carefully or carelessly?
1. The idea of _keeping your identity small_.
1. How my opinion on wearing masks has changed pretty rapidly.
