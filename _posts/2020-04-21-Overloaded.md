The last few weeks have been strange and familiar. Again I am finding myself doing more and getting less done. Fragmented and unsatisfied. Somehow the sum seems _less_ than its parts.

The parts are new, great, inspiring, and comforting. But I have been unable to arrange the puzzle pieces yet.

- Morning Pages
- Writing the blog daily
- Studying daily
- Posting on my professional blog daily
- Working four to six hours
- A new mobility routine
- Meditation
- Cooking and healthy eating
- Many more calls and chats with friends and family
- Spending time with my partner
- Working on projects
- Reading

Those are the puzzle pieces. What shape and image the puzzle will be - TBD.
