Prediction: Tomorrow's inauguration goes off without a hitch. 

Here is my thinking: 

1. Trump has signaled 'I won't back you up.' 
1. Security everywhere is going to be BEEFY.
1. The near-universal condemnation of the January 6th attacks on The Capital leaves little room for revolutionary thinking.

Confidence: 70%

Metics: No bombings, no stormed buildings, no military in the streets, and no dead-people.
