To start, some quotes from the book...

Why:
> There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.

> The position of perfect readiness: “mind like water”. Imagine throwing a pebble into a still pond. How does the water respond? The answer is, totally appropriately to the force and mass of the input; then it returns to calm. It doesn’t overreact or under react.

Quality of thinking is not the problem:
> Upping the quality of your thinking and commitments does not diminish the quantity of potentially relevant and important stuff to manage.

It is simple:
> Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop”, which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed.

> You must use your mind to get things off your mind.

> …you have to think about your ‘stuff’ more than you realize but not as much as you’re afraid you might.

> “The beginning is half of every action.” - Greek Proverb

> When is a problem a project? Always.

To finish, a condensed version in my own words:

> Unavoidably, thoughts and problems will come to mind. If you don't process them they will limit, clutter, distract, and nag your mind. However, if you process them in a considered manner, repetitive thoughts can give way to new and interesting ones and problems can become projects that get done and better your life.    

In part two we will jump into the methods of the system.
