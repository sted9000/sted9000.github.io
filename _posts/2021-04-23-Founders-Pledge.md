I am thinking of taking both the founders pledge and the giving what we can pledge.

- They commit you to give so you don't have to wake up a moral hero every morning
- Making this one decision frees up your mind to think about solving problems
- Perhaps it will provide some real and joyous motivation
- Pre-commitment devices (like these pledges) are similar to freerolls in that they are helpful mechanisms for aligning incentives and being the best version of yourself
