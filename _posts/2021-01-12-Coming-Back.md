Finally back home after three weeks away, x-mas, new years, and a lot of time to clear my head, I feel like I need to rush back into action. But I have learned that that is a silly approach. I can handle only a few things at a time or I lose control of my sanity. Only once those few things get automated into the background should I progress. I feel weak and childish for this being the case, but the consequences of false confidence here are worse. 

For now, it is as simple as getting 9 hours in bed each night and blocking out 4 hours to get some meaningful programming done. If I can do this for the next two weeks I will be thrilled. 

Good luck us.
