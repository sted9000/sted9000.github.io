Yesterday my girlfriend was accepted to grad school. It was a day filled with joy, hugs, and tears. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is an opportunity of a lifetime for her.

As the excitement wears off I find myself feeling very proud of her, but not in the way I would have thought. I am not proud of her for _getting in_, but I am proud of the _hope she permitted herself to have_. I am not proud of her _good test scores_, but I am proud of that she _studied and showed up for the test_.
