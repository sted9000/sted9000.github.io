Have just gently cajoled another friend onto this blogging everyday bet and after having completed a month if blogging myself it seems a good time reflect on its evolving status.

One, as you can tell if you have been reading, I have lots of silly ideas in my head and it seems sane put a point on them and then drop them. So far so good with this.

Two, it is part of a slow moving, ongoing, collaboration with friends. A welcomed nicety when you are separated by much latitude and longitude from most of the people you hold dear.

Three, it is not the time suck I once imagined. And most of the time spent is enjoyable (writing the blog) or informative (editing). Almost no time is spent formatting, posting, or any boring repetitive work.

Four, my narcissistic ego really enjoys saying
> That reminds me of a blog I once wrote.
