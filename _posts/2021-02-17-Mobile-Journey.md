Today I created my first custom component that is styled and runs equally well on Android and IOS. Very cool. The journey I am on -- to build a production mobile app -- is going to be a long and difficult one. I am going to have to learn as much as possible, and probably more importantly, accept what I do not have the time to learn and what would be better handled by professionals. 

The journey continues tomorrow morning with a lesson from a programmer I found in a slack channel from Nigeria. Can't make this stuff up.
