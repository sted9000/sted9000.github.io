I have not experienced the whole "dog owner" (not a good phrase) experience. But approaching 500 days with Frank (my dog) in my life, I want to get down a few observations:

- I very seldom walk in a straight line. He is always under my feet and keeps me on my toes. If I ever learn to dance, Frank will deserve most of the credit.
- If you are on the fence about getting a dog, my advice would be not to get one if you live in the city (otherwise yes). Frank loves being outside and it kills me that he only gets to go outside for minutes a day. And frankly, I think it is a bit cruel and selfish to knowingly get a dog without the intention to be outside as much as possible with them. 
- If you like going on walks, dog ownership is not much work at all. Otherwise, it is a chore.
- Having someone who is always (almost) willing to play, roll around on the floor with you, and who doesn't think you are completely insane for using a goofy child voice is great.
- I hear people harp on a dog's unconditional love. It is true and it is wonderful. However, I was under a misconception. Unconditional love does not imply that he is always happy with you, just that he is quick to forgive and always happy to when you wake up or come home.   
- Owning a dog is one more step and added stress to all travel plans. Luckily, we have a great family who loves taking care of him.
