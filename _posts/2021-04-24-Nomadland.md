Nomadland Review

It makes you think and feel. The main character Fern had one flaw she could not let go of the past. Her memories which she cherished so much wouldn't let her be happy in the present and defined her future. 

Perhaps, living with memories is a balancing act. You remember and honor the memories when you are with friends and family members who shared those memories. But don't be captured and shackled by the stories of the past.
