You can view aspects of life either as a series of many independent games or as one long evolving one.

Currently I am inclined towards favoring the long game and I am realizing some of the benefits of doing so.

Practice and study don't make much sense for short independent games.

An over-arching sense of calm and it-is-ok-ness is present in the long game.

Small decisions somehow matter more yet weigh less in longer games because you can imagine them accumulating.
