Learning #5 from Carl Rogers

My answer to _are humans good or evil_ is "both". At times we are selfish, destructive, and flat-out cruel. At times we are generous, growing, and kind. We are not inherently one or the other. Rogers has his take

> It has been my experience that persons have a basically positive direction. In my deepest contacts with individuals in therapy, even those whose troubles are most disturbing, whose behavior has been most anti-social, whose feelings seem most abnormals, I find this to be true. When I can sensitively understand the feelings which they are expressing, when I am able to accept them as separate persons in their own right, then I find that they tend to move in certain directions. 

A better way of looking at it. Rather than good or bad, moving towards positive or negative. Rather than adjectives, people become verbs.
