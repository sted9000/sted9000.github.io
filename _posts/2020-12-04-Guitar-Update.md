It has been a month or two "playing" 10 minutes per night. I am still only practicing chords, but I can see improvement. I am getting between 10-20 chords per minute now compared to 4 or 5 when I started. Just yesterday I played a few chords without looking before placing my fingers on the frets. 

I have no idea if my practice method is good or bad, but I am looking forwards to one day playing a simple song.
