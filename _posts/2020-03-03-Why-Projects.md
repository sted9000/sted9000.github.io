Why am I doing x, y, or z?

Often I worry that the answer is, _so I can say that I am_.

The good thing about this problem is that it is easy to prove my motivations are genuine.
Simply try to stop sharing your projects and see what happens.

Is it hard to not share? Do you get more or less from them when you don't share?
