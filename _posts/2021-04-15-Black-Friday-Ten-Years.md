Today is the tenth anniversary of _Black Friday_ -- the day online poker was shut down in the United States. My first inclination is that I should have let it go at that point. My second thought is that today I talked to three _future life-long friends_ that I met by not letting go.

So, in conclusion, I am a helpless optimist and the only positive action I can muster at the moment is to give thanks. Thank you online poker for what you taught me, the independent nomadic lifestyle you provided, and, most importantly, the people you put in my path along the way.
