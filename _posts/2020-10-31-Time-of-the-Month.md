These next few sentences are going to get me into trouble. But I think it is kind, compassionate, and meaningful - so I will write on.  

I think it is worth distinguishing "that time of the month" from the rest of the month and have a separate set of rules for each. On those few days of the month, rather than engaging in emotional conversations, you (the man) should listen to your partner and not engage. Rather than spending time together, you should schedule some time to be apart. Rather than say what you think needs to be said, you should write it down and see if it still needs to be expressed a few days later. And you should give your partner more hugs and kisses.

If all that fails (which it inevitably will), take solace in a Robin Williams bit where he suggests more women leaders are needed: They won't use the nukes like men. They don't want to kill everyone. But they want real tough negotiations every twenty-eight days.
