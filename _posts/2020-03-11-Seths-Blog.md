If you read this blog daily and do not read [Seths Godin's blog](https://www.seths.blog) I beg you to do the opposite. If you still feel like reading mine afterwards, bonus, but please please read his first. No disservice of trying to describe it, I will only say that I greatly value getting to look at the world through his eyeballs every day. Enjoy.
