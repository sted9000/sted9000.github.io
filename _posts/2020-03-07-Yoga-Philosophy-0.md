I am thoroughly enjoying my growing yoga routine. My body feels powerful and relaxed and my mind feels renewed and fresh after each practice.

Wanting to go a bit deeper, I picked up a yoga book and I'm not sure that was a good idea.

I want to document my first impressions here and see if they change over time (as green cult entrant's minds have been known to do).

- The principles are inspiring and motivating - lean into pain rather than turn away, consistency, body-mind connection, self responsibility, etc.     

- The philosophical doctrine seems beyond goofy and woo-woo beyond belief. Where as you can take other religious ideas as metaphor, it is hard to see the metaphor in _blocked emotions are located in pelvic chakras_.  

- The philosophy has similarities to Buddhism - uprooting negative aspects of the mind and the emphasis on experience as the highest form of knowledge.

Going to stick with the book and the practice and see if I can't separate what I perceive as dogma from the real benefits. Check back in in a few months.
