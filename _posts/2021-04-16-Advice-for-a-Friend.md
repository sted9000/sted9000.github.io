While I like the saying _wisdom is often nothing more than being able to follow your own advice_, I think I like _what advice would you give to a close friend_ even more.

The latter saying removes your personal baggage while retaining the heartfelt and human sentiment. 

So I aim to start taking my own advice and listening to the voice in my head coming from a good friend :)
