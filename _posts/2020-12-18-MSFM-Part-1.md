I loved the book.

You can tell it is a man's life work bound up in 150 pages. And what a life it was. Moreover, is the fact that he somehow makes his experience in the concentration camps seem relatable to us 21st-century softies far removed from the hardship of being a Jew in Nazi Germany. I suppose that is the job of a psychologist — to make unique experiences and the mental life that comes with them accessible — but he does a great job. 

In the next few post I want to highlight some of the things that struck me from the book.
