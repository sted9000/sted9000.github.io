I struggle calling bull-shit.

Yes, in the very moment I call bull-shit it feels good – empowering. But, after the fact, upon realizing that calling bull-shit was motivated by ego rather than compassion, I feel small and petty.

Now I am gun-shy even when bull-shit does should be called – both for the sake of the listener and the bull-shitter. The listener maintains a connection with reality and the bull-shitter benefits from correction.   

Maybe I can square this by knowing that while calling bull-shit is darkly motivated, the next sentence need not be. It might be possible to have a very different motive for that next sentence.
