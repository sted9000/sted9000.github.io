Last month happened upon a wallet on a park bench. Hesitation arose because picking it up was inviting responsibility, hassle, and wasted time into our lives.  However, our curiosity got the better of us.
Long-story-short, this week we received a voice message from Billy L., the wallet's owner. The message was heartfelt and brought a tear to my eye.
 
This story is not meant to be self-congratulatory, but rather to serve as a reflection as to why this specific type of joy is not a larger driver of my motivations and behavior. It feels like it should be.
