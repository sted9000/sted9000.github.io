A few days ago I heard a very very very simple and retrospectively _obvious_ piece of professional advice. And I have felt the power and wisdom of this advice in my work ever since. Aka: My work has been much better.

Which has me wondering...

What are the similar pieces of advice in other aspects of life? How and why are they be so powerful?

So far I have theorized that they might share these attributes:

1. Come from a respected or intriguing source.
2. Are very simple. One thought or state of mind. No more.
3. Are _obvious_. Meaning that you have felt them to be true before.
4. They are widely applicable, don't require much discernment, or change based on context.

That said I am still looking for the specific cases to prove my theorizing.

Until Tomorrow. Be well.
