Today I would like to thank a few people that I in my estimation have the most to do with my current physical health, which today is the object of great joy and gratitude.

First my parents for my genes, thank you.

Second my funcional teachers. Among other things you have taught me how to get stronger where it matters, how to rest, and how to not chronically injure yourself while exercising. Thank you.

Third to my yoga instructor and massage therapist. To be honest I have no idea what these activities are doing for me other that making me feel better. None the less, thank you.

And finally to my partner who not only puts up with my obsession and rituals related to sleep, but facilitates them. Thank you.
