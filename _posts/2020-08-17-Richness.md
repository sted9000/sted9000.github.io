I say a lot and do very little, but the following truly needs to happen. I need to become financially independent. And soon. I will not be 50 years old and thinking about finances. I refuse. Life is too short.

Many make the case that if you find what you love and they pay you for it, then you are not 'working'. There is some truth and wisdom in that. However, that is not what I want. If 'they' are paying you and you 'need' the money, you are a slave - full stop. That you enjoy the work is great, but I am sure some slave, somewhere, enjoyed doing his masters chores. While he wasn't working per se, he didn't know what he was missing either.

My definition of financially independent is what Scott Galloway calls "rich", which is having passive income greater than your burn. I think it is important to be strict here. Passive income means truly passive income, or it will still occupy a disproportionate piece of your mind. And your burn should include everything - expenses, taxes, and savings or you will still need to think about finances.

My goal is that within the next four years to have this taken care of. In a future blog post I will try to sketch out the plan to get there.
