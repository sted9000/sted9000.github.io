Again...

1. The little grocery in our neighborhood. All the essentials and super nice people. What a grocery should be. I will miss it.   
1. Web Storm IDE. This is my favorite new programming tool.
1. The little amount of impulse control that I have. While I don't have a ton, I am grateful for the bit I have.

Until tomorrow, be well.
