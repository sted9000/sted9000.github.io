Hola Martu.
I want to offer you a freeroll - a bet where you win if I fail to achieve my objective.
Please help me learn something new :)

I was inspired by a guy in the bosque de palermo juggling 6 balls at once. Really cool. I thought if he can do 6, I surely can do 4.

Freeroll: I need be able to juggle four balls before July 11th 2019.

Amount: 1 eth ($240 as of today).
Eth is digital-currency that is really cool.
I have set up a wallet for you where you will receive the eth if I lose. You don't need to do anything.

I will post updates below. GL us.
