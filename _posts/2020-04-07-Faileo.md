A [new freeroll](https://freerollio.github.io/#0x70bc8677e8e096c01cf71fea276eba6543ca3deb929d42761219ef4784e920b8) has been issued.

A 100 Day Challenge to Eat in Mode ~~Paleo~~ Faileo.

The idea is that we should always try to eat a healthful diet (in this case a Paleolithic Diet), but we are certain to fail often because we are human. We like indulging, sharing meals with family, and eating ice-cream when feeling blue. The twist of Faileo is what happens after the meal, day, or week when you _fail_. **If you simply start eating healthfully again after failing you are doing the diet correctly**. It is that simple.

And if you are Faileo'ing correctly you are bound to start having some impressive STREAKS of of healthful meals. This Faileo Challenge is aiming to have the following STREAKS at the end of 100 days of failing:

1. 1x 30 Meal
2. 2x 20 Meal
3. 3x 10 Meal
4. 10x 5 Meal

Good Luck Us and follow the streak [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BBLoYq4cmib7F2Tk8)
