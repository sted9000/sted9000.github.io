It struck me the other day that I now feel about programming the way I felt about poker ten years ago. My root motivation is very much different, but the end feeling is the same - the drive to consume and learn as much as possible. 

Last night I stayed up late eating ice cream and reading an article on the evolution of website styling practices. It was a blast. 

This replay of a decade ago comes along with some baggage. For example: I am more than a bit worried that I possess 'fatal flaws' when it comes to my professional growth and success. But the baggage is not all negative. I am very much looking forward to drawing on my experience from my wholly mediocre poker career to turbo-boost my new obsession.
