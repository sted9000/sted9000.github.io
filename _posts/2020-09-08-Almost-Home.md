I am wonderful at making excuses not to do my work (this blog may well be one of them). This part of myself and I are not on good terms - she lures me successfully, leaves me the morning after, and I can only shake my head and say "she got me again." That said, I have had 'actual' excuses not to be working recently. Moving, family, more moving logistics...

All that is a preamble to say, I am almost back to being back to having nothing to do. When that is the case, I sometimes work.
