Three ideas from the [econtalk episode](https://www.econtalk.org/sebastian-junger-on-tribe/) with S. Junger:

>"What it seems to be is that if you give people an urgent task, it gives them the opportunity to stop thinking about themselves." - S. Junger

The idea is that we are a lot more self-centered today because we are less enmeshed in roles that are vital for our community.
Maybe self-centeredness is an effect rather than a cause of some ills.  

>"And our journalists, as well. One of the things that disturbs me about journalism today is that journalists have just given up any pretense of objectivity; and indulge in that precise emotion: Contempt." - R. Roberts

A definition of contempt:
The feeling or attitude of regarding someone or something as inferior, base, or worthless; scorn.

We should always be suspect of contempt because it is the easiest reaction.

Lastly, tribalism is a wholly negative word these days. But maybe it should be looked at as a part of our nature and like most parts of our nature, leads to both good and evil.

A great conversation full of new important moral ideas to think about.
