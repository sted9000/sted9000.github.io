I heard something that rang true to me about a difference between books and podcasts (while listening to a podcast). In a non-fiction book, a relatively equal amount of time and emphasis is given to each idea presented. Whereas in a podcast, the presenter or interviewee tends to steer back to the few ideas that he thinks are the most important. You are not left with two pages of notes when you finish a podcast (as you are when you finish a book). Rather, you have one or two ideas whose emphasis has been stressed and whose value has been made clear. So I suppose a book is more of a "choose your own take-aways" and podcasts are more "this is what I want you to know". Both useful, but different.
