An Aniversary: One year ago my girlfriend was admitted to grad-school. To this day we are in shock that she was admitted and given a full scholarship. Sometimes we just shake our heads silently in disbelief. 

Tonight we will celebrate with ShakeShack. We are celebrating her courage to apply, our good fortune that she was accepted, and the beautiful world where people come together from all around the globe to study rocks.
