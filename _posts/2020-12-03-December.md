Not much to say today (unfortunately?), so you are stuck with gratitude. 

1. Taylor Swift. She lifted my girlfriend out of a seriously bad mood today. I might not be a fan of your music, but please keep making it.
1. The Woodlands. A large and beautiful cemetery here on the west side of Philadelphia that I have been walking in every day. A nice mix of peace, green, sunshine, and perspective.
1. Sardines packed in olive oil. 12grams of fat, 21grams of protein, 0 carbs squeezed into a can and ready to use as both the main attraction and the dressing in a simple salad.
