Book Review: Show Your Work!

We live in a strange connected world and this book tries to be a manual for creatives in such a world. On a high level, the book prescribes dropping your ego by not focusing on yourself and not waiting for perfection to share your craft. Instead, it promotes finding your community, sharing ideas freely, and teaching as you are learning. 

The purpose of Showing Your Work is three-fold: First, you can gain a following who can support you. Secondly, you can find your _scenus_, or group of peers who collectively create masterpieces. Third of all, you help others by sharing your work. 

The book is a bit lax on the mechanisms for showing your work, but then again, the book is for creative people who should be able to figure it out.
