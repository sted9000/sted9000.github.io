_False praise_ surely exists and in a harmful form. However, I think it exists in a kind and deeply productive form as well. 

When someone is trying and not yet succeeding (aka failing) false praise can be beneficial. If it is taken literally, the false praise is merely a lie. But I think that if the false praise is conveyed in a way that presents "I see you are trying. Keep trying. I am proud of you for trying", then the false praise is not a lie. 

The kindness comes from letting them know that you are with them in the journey. Productivity comes from providing a sense of self-worth and a spark of hope.
