Another item I want to splurge on when I am filthy rich: A Cold Plunge. Having a dedicated cold tub would be great not for any of the following professed benefits:

- Lowering body fat
- Increasing hormone levels
- Improving sexual performance and fertility
- Lowering blood sugar
- Cutting food cravings
- Improving adrenal function
- Fixing thyroid issues
- Enhancing immune function
- Improving sleep quality
- Increasing pain tolerance
- Reducing inflammation

... but just because it is invigorating and it would make you talk to yourself in a really funny way each day.
