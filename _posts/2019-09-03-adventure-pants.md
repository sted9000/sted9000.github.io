I am wondering what accounts for the diffenences in preference with regards to lifestyle. Specifically between those who choose a nomadic, freewheeling, whitewater rafting instructor style and those choosing a more routinized, behind a computer, travel a few weeks a year, planning to have kids style.

I believe that most people in each camp imagine the other camp as having missed something fundemental or posses wholey negative traits that if they only could get through they would switch camps.

I think this is partially right. Each camp is missing something. However that does not mean that if they werent missing it that they would convert.

Conclusion - The iron law of opprotunity cost makes itself known once again.
