A [new freeroll](https://freerollio.github.io/#0xb08967ee14b9567b6818fded2ed4eb7b4d97b9069ba566f20ec5dc74e5aa77c8) has been gifted.

This one is concerning the new reading habit I am trying to build and ties together some advice from various sources.

1. Kevin Kelly's advice for the easiest way to improve ones life: Read 10 book a year.
1. Atomic Habit's principles of identity being key to habit formation.
1. The idea of not reading journalism pretending to be science.  

The freeroll is that I must 'become a reader' (identity) by reading six non-fiction books by the end of the year (rate of ten books per year) that were published before 2015 (no journalism).

Good luck us.
