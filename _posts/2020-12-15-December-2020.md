A few cool tools that I have been enjoying:

- SASS Syntax: An older version of SCSS (a web stylesheet syntax) that is more efficient to type. It also helps with learning CSS variables as you can't copy and paste CSS styles into SASS. 
- SSH Config File: Rather than a long command each time you want to access a remote server, simply type ```ssh <project_name>```.
- Notion.so: It is very powerful, however I am enjoying the small features (such as its use of markdown) and the beautiful interface.

None of these tools are mindblowing, but they all are practical and thoughtful.
