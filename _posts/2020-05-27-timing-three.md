Recently I have been focusing on timing as information.

At the poker tables, you are looking to gather as much reliable information as you can. The amount of time that someone takes to make a decision can signal information about what cards they are holding.

In trying to find an analogy to life regarding timing as information I only managed to find another area to use timing as information at the poker tables.

When you ask someone something, the timing of the response rarely tells you much about the decision or the decision process, but it can tell you a lot about the person.

"Want to go on a trip to Chile?" - [An immediate] Yes, I'm in.

"Want to go on a trip to Chile?" - I will get back to you... Yes, I'm in.

Two different personalities discerned by timing.

Hopefully, I will report back soon to see if this insight had any practical value at the tables.
