So I have been listening a little bit to The Glen Show. Two accomplished and reasonalble sounding black scholars discuss race in America. I am troubled by how much I agree with them. Is it because I emotionally like what they are saying? Or is it because the arguments they present constitue the best evidence I have heard on the issue? Until I do the work and think it out for myself I will not know.
