Frustrated the other day, my girlfriend said "I don't know how you don't get bothered by these things." My response was "I think I have read so much stoicism that I am actually starting to believe it".

While this holds for many things, I still have many aspects of life where my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are way out of what with what I believe to be true.
How does one close the gap between what you are and what you believe? I have no f=+)ing clue. But my guess would be a combination of the following:

1. Simply, try to start acting in accordance with your beliefs.
2. Just wait it out. The gap might close with age.
3. Look for the hidden motivations that are steering you away from your professed beliefs.
