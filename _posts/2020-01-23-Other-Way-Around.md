The content of discourse seems to be different and worse than it has been in the past.
More sensational, eager to blame, and name-calling.
With less compassion, willingness to talk through ideas with trade-offs, and thoughtful solutions.

Idea: The structure and form of our communication is a source of this worse content, rather than a result of it.

Less 3 hour long phone calls with Mom or friends.
Less sitting at the bar after work with co-workers a few times a week.
I had the vague notion that less of these were, in part, a result of worse discourse content, but maybe it is the other way around.
