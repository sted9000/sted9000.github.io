A few quotes I am pondering: 

> Bright light, dark shadow - Laird Hamilton

Do you have to have a dark side to be truly jovial and beaming with happiness? Or perhaps, you need only to experience the depths of despair momentarily. Or, maybe an occasional meditation on death or suffering can do the trick? I am not exactly how this phrase is correct, but it feels right. To have the brightest smile in the room, you need to have touched darkness in some form. 

> What would the world look like if they are right? - Jason Calacanus

His point is that most ideas that have change the world recently have sounded silly when introduced. And if that is the case, how would one go about picking winners and losers? This is a question that helps. 

Example: Robinhood's pitch was that young people who are living with their parents, worse off financially than their parents, and have little disposable income want to invest... And we are going to let them do it for free. Sounds insane, but I can see how asking this question could help an investor.
