This winter I have been loving drinking tea. I have a nice setup:

- My grandmother's china teacups
- An electric kettle
- Teabag plates courtesy of my mother

I must drink 10+ cups a day.

I have 3 flavors of no-caff tea and each time I trade out a used teabag for another it causes me to stop and think for a split second _what tea flavor do I feel like having?_ While the matter is extremely trivial, the act of checking in with myself is a nice break from the rest of my go-go-go day. Nothing to accomplish, no one to please, nothing to say, no guilt to be felt, no I should be doing something else, no way to improve, just, what flavor do I feel like.
