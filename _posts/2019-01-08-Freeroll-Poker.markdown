I am looking forward to another summer in Vegas.
Don't want to be too rusty.
And recently I have been finding more and more reasons not to play.

So [here](https://freerollio.github.io/#0xa5865db7685fa39eb0a03326e0cdb72dd01f845e889d7635c68005a95a25e8ca) is the freeroll.
I need to play one hundred hours before June first. The plan is to have fun and play an hour a day after working to wind down.

I will post the receipts and results [here]().

Good luck us.
