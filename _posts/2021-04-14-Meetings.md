Trying to get a software product off the ground I am finding myself in five to ten meetings a week. Here are my thoughts so far:

1. Talking with professionals about your product is very educational. What is unclear? What questions do you not have good answers for? What is their first reaction?
1. Preparing for meetings can be a good forcing function to help clarify ideas that are too vague.
1. There is a lot of variance in freelance professionals and with a little bit of good judgment you can save a lot of time by not accepting meetings with the bottom 50%.
1. If you have more than one meeting in a day, you will be hard-pressed to get any meaningful undistracted work done (I am working on improving this).
1. Schedule the next meeting (if necessary) at the end of the current meeting. This saves a lot of time scheduling.
1. Nobody minds if you take a second to think and/or talk slowly.
