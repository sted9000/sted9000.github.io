In one sense, 'productivity' is a profane concept. One could have the most 'productive' life while also having a meaningless one. And one could have an unproductive life while having it be rich and deep and full of meaning.

In another sense, 'productivity' is a sacred concept. It allows the dull activities of life to be kept to a minimum and the meaningful to present itself more often.

This is all a preamble to say that I want to increase my typing speed. I blog. I write code. I take notes on my opponents at the poker table. All these would benefit from more 'productivity' at the keyboard. Over a lifetime, this could add up to a lot of time saved and more meaning.

Currently I'm at around 50 - 60wpm. Over the following months I will formulate a plan to improve, put in some effort, and report back.
