We have quarantined strictly for two weeks and have gotten tested. Now we are ready for a mini-adventure -- staying with my grandfather for a week. 

This is exciting to me for a couple of reasons:
- A change-up thrown into our daily routines means novel decisions and a chance for new experiences. 
- My grandfather is in a new season of life. It will be like getting to know him anew.
- More time outdoors with Frank. 
- Movies. We don't own a TV, so it will be nice to watch movies every night. 

I fully realize that these are not the things that are supposed to excite an adult, but what-ya-gonna-do.

Trip report forthcoming.
