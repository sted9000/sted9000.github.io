My recent post of [Mind-Body Paradox](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/05/04/mind-body-paradox) is not sitting well. More bluntly, I dislike almost everything about it and am annoyed when remembering it.

1. It is very unclear.
2. It is more of a 'thinking out loud' post but I wrote it smugly as fully fleshed out idea post.
3. I tried to defend it (rather than accept that it was unclear) when my partner said "I don't get it".
4. It is a symptom of a common phenomenon in my mind where a smart person says something smart -> I have one clever-feeling thought of my own -> Because the thought felt clever, I take it as correct or insightful without any reflection or consideration. Usually the thought is pretty garbage or needs a second draft.  

It's not honest or thoughtful. Sorry reader(s). I will try to do better tomorrow.
