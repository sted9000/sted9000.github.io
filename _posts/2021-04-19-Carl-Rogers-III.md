Learning #3 from Carl Rogers

> Experience is, for me, the highest authority.

I often remember an experience I had on a silent meditation retreat. It was as if my life before the retreat my life was very dream-like and life on the retreat I was _awake and alive_ for the first time in my life. 

To this day, a cynical voice in my head says "stop being so dramatic, it could not have been THAT different." But if I am not to trust that experience, what can I trust? After all, I was there and I could reproduce the experience if I wanted to.

> My experience is not authoritative because it is infallible. It is the basis of authority because it can always be checked in new primary ways. In this way its frequent error or fallibility is always open to correction.
