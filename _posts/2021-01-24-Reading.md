Freeroll #3 for 2021 is a repeat from 2020: Read ten books.

Last year my idea was to change my identity into that of a reader. However, I procrastinated and crammed at the end. It was a good experience, but it did not change my identity in the way I had hoped.  

This year I will modify the freeroll to read one book each month February through November. The only restriction on books is that they cannot have been published after January 2020. 

This structure will force me to create a daily reading habit, and hopefully, the habit sticks.
